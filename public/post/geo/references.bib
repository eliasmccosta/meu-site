abstract = {The use of spectral data to estimate the structural parameters of vegetation has been considered as one of the most important applications of the remote sensing of ecosystems. In this paper, spectral enhancements and transformations such as vegetation indices, vegetation fraction from mixture analysis from TM/LANDSAT data were used to estimate structural parameters of ‘Floresta Nacional do Araripe', in the State of Cear{\'{a}}. The image was calibrated at ground radiance and had the outliers removed before any further processing. Green vegetation fraction as well as vegetation indices and the spectral response of individual bands were all positively and significantly correlated with estimates of the mean height of the sample plot, basal area at the breast height, and basal area at the ground. The correlation coefficients varied from 0.33 to 0.60. The best linear relationships obtained by regression between simple ratio and the structural indices of the vegetation are presented.},

abstract = {Existing sample data are important for digital soil mapping. Different sample points possess different representativeness. The representativeness of samples influences the soil mapping result greatly. However, few study focus on assessing the representativeness of single sample. In this paper, we proposed a method to identify representative samples from existing samples collected from multiple resources. The basic idea of the method was to use clusters of environmental covariates to approximate types of soil variations, and check the occupancy of the existing samples in centroids of environmental clusters. Those samples locating in typical locations or centroids of environmental clusters were considered as representative samples. In this paper, the proposed method was used to discern representative samples in 282 soil samples in Anhui Province, China. SOM content was mapped using a similarity based mapping method. Two cases with different training samples (representative samples, non-representative samples, and training samples including representative and non-representative samples) and validation samples were set to compare the mapping results and accuracies. The results showed that the SOM content maps predicted using representative training samples had generally higher accuracy than the results produced using non-representative samples, and comparative accuracies with the results produced using full training samples. To discern representative samples is helpful for understanding the soil-landscape relationships in an area and the proposed method can be used to design supplementary samples for a better soil mapping result. Mapping results and accuracies showed that different training and validation sample sets impacted the mapping results and accuracies greatly, which indicates that researchers should be cautious when using randomization to obtain training and validation subsets for soil mapping.},

Atmospheric correction by means of radiative transfer models is a way of eliminating or minimizing this problem. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the atmospheric correction of an image of theALOS/AVNIR-2 sensor using the6S (Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) model. The sensor filter function and the calibration coefficientswere implemented in the 6S model. Then an AVNIR-2 image was corrected for atmospheric effects. Samples were collected in the non-corrected and corrected images to evaluate the atmospheric correction by comparing the surface bidirectional reflectance (corrected) with bidirectional reflectance at satellite level (non-corrected). The results show that surfacebidirectional reflectance valuescorrectedby the modelare similar to thespectral signaturesof each target,while the bidirectionalreflectance values from uncorrectedimage were not similar to expected target spectral response. It is concluded that the atmospheric correction of AVNIR-2 enabled the calculation of surface bidirectional reflectance. This correction is necessary especially when the images will be used to estimate surface parameters through target spectral characteristics.The adapted 6S model is suitablefor the atmospheric correction of ALOS/AVNR-2 images},

abstract = {Image geometric accuracy and spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions are important aspects for se- lecting satellite imagery for agricultural and environmental monitoring. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the geometrical and resolution characteristics of RapidEye images (processing level: 3A). Three images were used in this study. These images were corrected for the atmospheric effects and stored in 16-bit radiometric resolution, where the surface refl ectance was determined and rescaled from 0 to 10,000. Eight points extracted from the orthophoto mosaic were used to evaluate the geometric characteristics of the orthorectifi ed images. Ten points extracted from these ortho- photo mosaics were used to register the images using fi rst-degree equations, in order to obtain homologous samples of pixels. Four pixels from Eucalyptus plantation, cultivated pasture, bare soil and water from a sand extraction pit and a river mouth were used to characterize spectrally the surface refl ectance derived from the RapidEye images. Results showed that average positional errors were 3.66 m and 10.07 m respectively for E and N coordinates, compliant with Cartographic Accuracy Standards (PEC) of class A at the scale of 1:20,000. Surface refl ectance of the selected targets were consistent with the typical refl ectance curves available in the literature. It is concluded that the RapidEye images are suitable for monitoring agricultural areas, pastures, forested areas and for environmental monitoring in general. The 12-bit quantization is interesting for these applications as it can represent a large variety of radiances coming from the surface.},

abstract = {Microarray studies yield data sets consisting of a large number of candidate predictors (genes) on a small number of observations (samples). When interest lies in predicting phenotypic class using gene expression data, often the goals are both to produce an accurate classifier and to uncover the predictive structure of the problem. Most machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, are useful for classification. However, these methods provide no insight regarding the covariates that best contribute to the predictive structure. Other methods, such as linear discriminant analysis, require the predictor space be substantially reduced prior to deriving the classifier. A recently developed method, random forests (RF), does not require reduction of the predictor space prior to classification. Additionally, RF yield variable importance measures for each candidate predictor. This study examined the effectiveness of RF variable importance measures in identifying the true predictor among a large number of candidate predictors. An extensive simulation study was conducted using 20 levels of correlation among the predictor variables and 7 levels of association between the true predictor and the dichotomous response. We conclude that the RF methodology is attractive for use in classification problems when the goals of the study are to produce an accurate classifier and to provide insight regarding the discriminative ability of individual predictor variables. Such goals are common among microarray studies, and therefore application of the RF methodology for the purpose of obtaining variable importance measures is demonstrated on a microarray data set. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, data, information and knowledge are still currently fragmented and at risk of getting lost if they remain in a paper format. To process this legacy data into consistent, spatially explicit and continuous global soil information, data are being rescued and compiled into databases. Thousands of soil survey reports and maps have been scanned and made available online. The soil profile data reported by these data sources have been captured and compiled into databases. The total number of soil profiles rescued in the selected countries is about 800,000. Currently, data for 117, 000 profiles are compiled and harmonized according to GlobalSoilMap specifications in a world level database (WoSIS). The results presented at the country level are likely to be an underestimate. The majority of soil data is still not rescued and this effort should be pursued. The data have been used to produce soil property maps. We discuss the pro and cons of top-down and bottom-up approaches to produce such maps and we stress their complementarity. We give examples of success stories. The first global soil property maps using rescued data were produced by a top-down approach and were released at a limited resolution of 1 km in 2014, followed by an update at a resolution of 250 m in 2017. By the end of 2020, we aim to deliver the first worldwide product that fully meets the GlobalSoilMap specifications.},

abstract = {Several techniques have been used to model the area covered by biomes or species. However, most models allow little freedom of choice of response variables and are conditioned to the use of climate predictors. This major restriction of the models has generated distributions of low accuracy or inconsistent with the actual cover. Our objective was to characterize the environmental space of the most representative biomes of Brazil and predict their cover, using climate and soil-related predictors. As sample units, we used 500 cells of 100 km2 for ten biomes, derived from the official vegetation map of Brazil (IBGE 2004). With a total of 38 (climatic and soil-related) predictors, an a priori model was run with the random forest classifier. Each biome was calibrated with 75{\%} of the samples. The final model was based on four climate and six soil-related predictors, the most important variables for the a priori model, without collinearity. The model reached a kappa value of 0.82, generating a highly consistent prediction with the actual cover of the country. We showed here that the richness of biomes should not be underestimated, and that in spite of the complex relationship, highly accurate modeling based on climatic and soil-related predictors is possible. These predictors are complementary, for covering different parts of the multidimensional niche. Thus, a single biome can cover a wide range of climatic space, versus a narrow range of soil types, so that its prediction is best adjusted by soil-related variables, or vice versa.},

abstract = {This study pursues the mapping of the distribution of topsoils and surface substrates of the Lake Manyara area of northern Tanzania. The nine soil and lithological target classes were selected through fieldwork and laboratory analysis of soil samples. High-resolution WorldView-2 data, TerraSAR-X intensity data, medium-resolution ASTER spectral bands and indices, as well as ENVISAT ASAR intensity and SRTM-X-derived topographic parameters served as input features. Objects were derived from image segmentation. The classification of the image objects was conducted applying a nonlinear support vector machine approach. With the recursive feature elimination approach, the most input-relevant features for separating the target classes were selected. Despite multiple target classes, an overall accuracy of 71.9{\%} was achieved. Inaccuracies occurred between classes with high CaCO3 content and between classes of silica-rich substrates. The incorporation of different input feature datasets improved the classification accuracy. An in-depth interpretation of the classification result was conducted with three soil profile transects.},

abstract = {In order to study sampling techniques useful for digital soil mapping (DSM), we evaluated the effect of changes in sampling density, based on data from areas already mapped by traditional methods, in regard to the accuracy of decision trees models for generating soil maps using DSM. In two watersheds in northwestern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 1:50,000 scale conventional soils maps were used as reference maps. From the ASTER - GDEM Global Digital Elevation Model and the hydrographic network, maps of predictive variables were generated: elevation, slope, curvature, flow length, flow accumulation, topographic wetness index, and Euclidian distance of the streams. We used random sampling, and tested sampling densities that ranged from 0.1 to 4 points per hectare. Models were trained using Weka software, generating predictive models using different sizes of the final node to obtain decision trees of different sizes. The results indicate that when the size of the decision tree was not controlled, an increase in sampling density resulted in greater overall accuracy in accordance with the basic reference maps and an increase in the number of predicted soil mapping units. When the size of decision trees was controlled, an increase in sampling density did not affect the overall accuracy and had a very slight influence on the number of predicted mapping units.},

The trail has monitored such as an open place for people visitations, outstanding off-road vehicles, causing various impacts such as trampling vegetation, soil erosion in the bed of the trail area, among other environmental imbalances posed by improper use of trails. A calculation technique of the Cross Sectional Area was used to analyze the impact of erosion on the trail bed, whose results showed progressive deepening of the bed, resulting in intensified and concentrated erosion, increasing even more the problems encountered in the trail, and also found that in some places there was an accumulation of sediment, and both the loss and the accumulation of sediments has a direct relationship with the slope and the type of local soil. Also was performed the use of photographic records to conduct a comparative analysis between two times when the trail had evidence of erosive processes and it was possible to register a drastic change occurred on site.},

abstract = {A Bayesian belief network (BBN) was developed to assess preferred combinations of trees in live fences and on pastures in silvopastoral systems. The BBN was created with information from Rivas, Nicaragua, using local farmer knowledge on tree species, trees' costs and benefits, farmers' expressed needs and aspirations, and scientific knowledge regarding tree functional traits and their contribution to ecosystem services and benefits. The model identifies combinations of trees, which provide multiple ecosystem services from pastures, improving their productivity and contribution to farmer livelihoods. We demonstrate how the identification of portfolios of multifunctional trees can satisfy a profile of desired ecosystem services prioritized by the farmer. Diagnostics using Bayesian inference starts with an identification of farmer needs and 'works backwards' to identify a silvopastoral system structure. We conclude that Bayesian belief networks are a promising modeling technique for multi-criteria decisions in farm adaptation processes, where interventions must be adapted to specific contexts and farmer preferences.},

abstract = {Water erosion negatively affects soil fertility, soil structure, and water availability to plants. Moreover, off-site erosion effects contribute to the sedimentation and eutrophication of water courses. The Grande River is one of the main tributaries of the Paran{\'{a}} River, and an important source of hydroelectric power in Brazil. The Upper Grande River Basin covers an area of 15,705 km2, mostly occupied by rangelands. Shallow and little permeable Cambisols are the predominant soil class in the basin, which, combined with the intensive and highly concentrated summer rainfall, characterize an erosion-prone scenario. The aim of this study was to model the soil losses and the sediment yield in the Upper Grande River Basin. It also sought to quantify the sediment delivery to the two main hydroelectric power plant reservoirs in the basin: Camargos/Itutinga and Funil. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were used to apply the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Sediment Delivery Distributed model (SEDD) in the study area. The models were calibrated using sediment transport data obtained from a river gauging station located in a subwatershed. RUSLE predictions estimated that the average soil losses in the Upper Grande River Basin were of 22.35 t ha− 1 yr− 1, and that bare soils, eucalypt and agriculture suffered the highest erosion rates among the identified land use classes. The average specific sediment yield in the basin was of 1.93 t ha− 1 yr− 1. According to the model calibration, the specific sediment yield predictions showed an error of 0.01 t ha− 1 yr− 1, or 0.6{\%}. Agriculture and eucalypt forests, which compose approximately 10{\%} of the study area, contribute to more than 40{\%} of the sediment yield in the basin. The model predictions estimated that 1.45 million t yr− 1 of sediments are delivered to the Camargos/Itutinga power plant reservoir, whereas the Funil power plant reservoir receives a sediment input of 1.68 million t yr− 1. Although model calibration yielded small errors in relation to the observed sediment measurements, the relative lack of available data has impaired a more thorough validation of the employed models. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the RUSLE/SEDD approach may be useful for analyzing sediment transport in Brazilian watersheds, where limited input data is available.},

abstract = {Soils are routinely sampled and characterized according to genetic horizons, resulting in data that are associated with principle dimensions: location (x, y), depth (z), and property space (p). The high dimensionality and grouped nature of this type of data can complicate standard analysis, summarization, and visualization. The "aqp" (algorithms for quantitative pedology) package was designed to support data-driven approaches to common soils-related tasks such as visualization, aggregation, and classification of soil profile collections. In addition, we sought to advance the study of numerical soil classification by building on previously published methods within an extensible and open source framework. Functions in the aqp package have been successfully applied to studies involving several thousand soil profiles.

abstract = {We present a new digital terrain analysis framework for digital soil mapping, referred to as contextual elevation mapping (ConMap). In contrast to common regression approaches based on features from digital terrain analysis, ConMap is not based on standard terrain attributes, but on elevation differences from the centre pixel to each pixel in circular neighbourhoods only. These differences are used as features in random forest regressions. We applied and validated the framework by predicting topsoil silt content in a loess region of 1150 km2 in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse, Germany. Three hundred and forty-two samples and a 20-m resolution digital elevation model were used for this illustration and validation. We compared ConMap with standard and multi-scale terrain analysis approaches as well as with ordinary kriging interpolations. Cross-validation root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 16.1 when the standard digital terrain analysis was used to 11.2 when ConMap was used. This corresponds to an increase in variance explained (R2) from 15 to 61{\%}. Even though ordinary kriging out-performed standard terrain analysis as well, the variance explained was 6{\%} smaller compared with that using ConMap. The results show that the geomorphic settings in the study area must have induced the spatial trend, which can be accounted for by ConMap over different scales. We conclude that ConMap shows great potential for digital soil mapping studies.},

abstract = {To predict soil maps, data-mining techniques can be utilised. The aim of these techniques is to extract hidden predictive knowledge from large databases. In terms of soil science they are able to learn the relationship between mapped soil classes as well as soil-forming factors, which can be used to predict soil classes in comparable landscape units. Thus, it is possible to automatically build reproducible digital soil maps, helping to speed up field mapping and to reduce costs. The main objective of this chapter is to compare the ability of different data-mining techniques and algorithms from statistics and information theory, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), linear regression, learning vector quantisation and classification trees. The techniques are discussed in terms of prediction accuracy and usability for GIS-based usage. Altogether 10 data-mining algorithms were tested to predict soil classes on the basis of 65-terrain attributes. Prediction accuracy is tested inside and outside the learning area to compare their generalisation ability. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT (Soils associated with rock outcrops in the Brazilian mountain ranges Mantiqueira and Espinha{\c{c}}o). Espinha{\c{c}}o and Mantiqueira are two mountain ranges of great importance in Brazil. In the uppermost parts of these areas, unique ecosystems occur, generally associated with rock outcrops, they are collectively called High Altitude Rocky Complexes. These environments show distinct soil and biota characteristics in relation to the surrounding biome. The soils are generally shallow, coarse textured, with high Al3+ and varying amounts of organic matter. Entisols, Inceptsols and Histosols are dominant, directly associated with the rock outcrops, and forming a complex mosaic of soils. Some of these soils are endemic, based on peculiar conditions of parent materials, topography and vegetation, and this pedodiversity is important for detecting unique and endangered soils. In these soils, organic matter is highly humified, with a great amount of soluble forms and conspicuous presence of charcoal. Spodic horizons and dark water rivers are typically associated with quartzite and quartzite outcrops, formed by illuviation of organic compounds, being less common in granitic rocks. The very low nutrient content of these soils and other environmental limitations required the development of specific physiological and morphological plant adaptations. Most high altitude environments are unstable under current climatic conditions, and anthropic interventions may be accelerating this process. Detailed soil surveys are necessary for a better understanding of the role of these soils in ecological processes and for the development of adequate conservation policies RESUMO (Solos associados aos afloramentos rochosos das Serras do Espinha{\c{c}}o e da Mantiqueira).

abstract = {Bulk density (Bd) can easily be predicted from other data using pedotransfer functions (PTF). The present study developed two PTFs (PTF1 and PTF2) for Bd prediction in Brazilian organic soils and horizons and compared their performance with nine previously published equations. Samples of 280 organic soil horizons used to develop PTFs and containing at least 80 g kg-1 total carbon content (TOC) were obtained from different regions of Brazil. The multiple linear stepwise regression technique was applied to validate all the equations using an independent data set. Data were transformed using Box-Cox to meet the assumptions of the regression models. For validation of PTF1 and PTF2, the coefficient of determination (R2 ) was 0.47 and 0.37, mean error -0.04 and 0.10, and root mean square error 0.22 and 0.26, respectively. The best performance was obtained for the PTF1, PTF2, Hollis, and Honeysett equations. The PTF1 equation is recommended when clay content data are available, but considering that they are scarce for organic soils, the PTF2, Hollis, and Honeysett equations are the most suitable because they use TOC as a predictor variable. Considering the particular characteristics of organic soils and the environmental context in which they are formed, the equations developed showed good accuracy in predicting Bd compared with already existing equations},

The approach incorporated quantitative and qualitative assessment, with geotechnologies (satellite image–landsat 5, global positioning system, geographic information system, digital mapping, software of digital image processing) adoption to perform an integrated analysis of environmental data. Primary soils information associated with terrain attributes and climate characteristics were used with geotechnologies to evaluation of the natural erosion potential, natural fertility, internal drainage and moisture soil retention capacity of soil. The land use, and land cover and the environmental laws were observed. The integrated analysis of these data allowed environmental stratification in different agroecological zones. These zones are defined to agricultural use; pastures; conservation of natural resources or ecological restoration. In Bandeirantes case study, the agroecological zones recommended for agriculture sum 1,150 km2. The evaluation for conservation of natural resources and ecological results in 310 km2, and for the areas recommended for pastures sum 1,650 km2 or 53{\%} of Bandeirantes municipality. This study allows conclude that the integrated analysis of environmental data with application of geotechnologies can subsidize a quantitative and qualitative assessment, stratifying the lands in different agroecological zones, each one with recommendations for sustainable use, and contributing as a powerful tool for spatial planning.},

The performed analysis by Random Forest models showed that channel base level, elevation, and lithology were the most important ones to explain the variability. The validation of the models showed similarity among sets for the prediction of sand, clay, and organic carbon contents, which explains the following values of spatial variability, respectively: 44, 40, and 33{\%}, for the spatial resolution of 30 m; and 45, 46, and 33{\%}, for the spatial resolution of 90 m.

abstract = {Knowledge of the quantity and quality of the material lost by soil erosion due to soil management is a basic need to identify land management zones in catchments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil management on the quantity and quality of soil material lost by erosion in the Posses sub-watershed, Municipality of Extrema, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Water and sediments lost by natural rainfall erosion were sampled from erosion plots located on a Red-Yellow Argisol (PVA) under the following systems: bare soil, subsistence farming (maize/beans/pumpkin/jack-beans/fallow), degraded pasture, well-managed pasture, and reforestation set up in 2013; and in a Argisol: reforestation set up in 2008, bare soil, and native forest. Ca, Mg, K, P, N and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were determined in sediment and soil samples (at 0-5 cm depth) for the determination of the runoff enrichment ratios. Management influences soil losses more so than water losses. Minor losses were found in reforestation set up in 2013 (soil); in well-managed pasture (water); and in reforestations (nutrients and SOM). These losses tend to stability with time. The general sequence of nutrient losses was N  {\textgreater}  Ca  {\textgreater}  Mg  {\textgreater}  K  {\textgreater}  P in PVA; and N  {\textgreater}  Ca  {\textgreater}  K  {\textgreater}  Mg  {\textgreater}  P in Argisol. Loss rates of SOM and N followed the order: bare soil  {\textgreater}  subsistence farming  {\textgreater}  degraded pasture  {\textgreater}  well-managed pasture  {\textgreater}  reforestation, in PVA; and bare soil  {\textgreater}  native forest  {\textgreater}  reforestation, in Argisol. Reforestation and wellmanagement pasture are effective conservation strategies in order to lower the erosion process in the Posses sub-watershed. Soil losses, as well as nutrients and organic matter losses were more influenced by soil management than water losses. The safeguarding native forest under Argisol is essential to the conservation of this pedoenvironment, especially in steep slopes.},

abstract = {A new method for a composite evaluation of atmospheric resistance, surface resistance, and evapotranspiration rate (??E) is applied to Landsat-5 TM. The method uses three equations to solve for three variables: the atmospheric resistance between the surface and the air (rae); the surface resistance (rs); and the vapour pressure at the surface (es). The novelty of this approach is the estimation of es, which is assessed using the decoupling coefficient (??) by Jarvis and McNaughton [Adv. Ecol. Res. 15 (1986) 1]. The input parameters are: surface temperature (Ts), net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), air temperature (Ta), and air humidity (ea). A time series (100 days) of field data collected for a wheat crop is used to illustrate the method, which is validated using latent heat fluxes recorded by the eddy covariance technique. The control of ras on ??E is expressed through the Surface Control Coefficient (SCC = 1 - ??), which is compared to soil moisture data. The application of the technique in a remote sensing monitoring context is demonstrated for a Danish agricultural landscape containing crops at different stages of development. For the satellite-based estimation of ??E and SCC, the variables Ts, Rn, and G are calculated on the basis of Landsat-5 TM, which leaves solar irradiance (for computing Rn), Ta, and ea as the only field data required. The method is directly applicable without any calibration when the soil surface is moist or when the vegetation cover is dense. Only for a dry bare soil surface, where the effective source area of water vapour is below the surface, is the modification of a surface humidity parameter (hs,max) required. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper describes a software tool for: (1) assessing uncertainties in environmental data; and (2) generating realisations of uncertain data for use in uncertainty propagation analyses: the "Data Uncertainty Engine (DUE)". Data may be imported into DUE from file or from a database, and are represented in DUE as objects whose positions and attribute values may be uncertain. Objects supported by DUE include spatial vectors, spatial rasters, time-series of spatial data, simple time-series and objects that are constant in space and time. Attributes supported by DUE include continuous numerical variables (e.g. rainfall), discrete numerical variables (e.g. bird counts) and categorical variables (e.g. land-cover). Once data are imported, an uncertainty model can be developed for the positional and attribute uncertainties of environmental objects. This is currently limited to probability models, but confidence intervals and scenarios will be provided in the future. Using DUE, the spatial and temporal patterns of uncertainty (autocorrelation), as well as cross-correlations between related inputs, can be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis. Alongside expert judgement, sample data may be used to help estimate uncertainties, and to reduce the uncertainty of the simulated output by ensuring each realisation reproduces the sample data. Most importantly, DUE provides a conceptual framework for structuring an uncertainty analysis, allowing users without direct experience of uncertainty methods to develop realistic uncertainty models for their data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mapping the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes is important for informing soil use and management decisions. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can quantitatively predict the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes. Key components of DSM are the method and the set of environmental covariates used to predict soil classes. Machine learning is a general term for a broad set of statistical modeling techniques. Many different machine learning models have been applied in the literature and there are different approaches for selecting covariates for DSM. However, there is little guidance as to which, if any, machine learning model and covariate set might be optimal for predicting soil classes across different landscapes. Our objective was to compare multiple machine learning models and covariate sets for predicting soil taxonomic classes at three geographically distinct areas in the semi-arid western United States of America (southern New Mexico, southwestern Utah, and northeastern Wyoming). All three areas were the focus of digital soil mapping studies. Sampling sites at each study area were selected using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). We compared models that had been used in other DSM studies, including clustering algorithms, discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression, neural networks, tree based methods, and support vector machine classifiers. Tested machine learning models were divided into three groups based on model complexity: simple, moderate, and complex. We also compared environmental covariates derived from digital elevation models and Landsat imagery that were divided into three different sets: 1) covariates selected a priori by soil scientists familiar with each area and used as input into cLHS, 2) the covariates in set 1 plus 113 additional covariates, and 3) covariates selected using recursive feature elimination.Overall, complex models were consistently more accurate than simple or moderately complex models. Random forests (RF) using covariates selected via recursive feature elimination was consistently the most accurate, or was among the most accurate, classifiers between study areas and between covariate sets within each study area. We recommend that for soil taxonomic class prediction, complex models and covariates selected by recursive feature elimination be used.Overall classification accuracy in each study area was largely dependent upon the number of soil taxonomic classes and the frequency distribution of pedon observations between taxonomic classes. Individual subgroup class accuracy was generally dependent upon the number of soil pedon observations in each taxonomic class. The number of soil classes is related to the inherent variability of a given area. The imbalance of soil pedon observations between classes is likely related to cLHS. Imbalanced frequency distributions of soil pedon observations between classes must be addressed to improve model accuracy. Solutions include increasing the number of soil pedon observations in classes with few observations or decreasing the number of classes. Spatial predictions using the most accurate models generally agree with expected soil-landscape relationships. Spatial prediction uncertainty was lowest in areas of relatively low relief for each study area.},

abstract = {In balanced sampling a linear relation between the soil property of interest and one or more covariates with known means is exploited in selecting the sampling locations. Recent developments make this sampling design attractive for statistical soil surveys. This paper introduces balanced sampling and demonstrates its potential utility and versatility. Latin hypercube sampling appears to be a special case of balanced sampling. When implemented as a balanced sampling design, the inclusion probabilities of the population units are known. Population parameters can then be estimated by design-based, model-assisted or model-based inference. In a simulation study balanced (b) random sampling, balanced coverage (bc) random sampling, and latin hypercube (lh) random sampling were compared in terms of the sampling distributions of number of unsampled marginal strata (U) measuring coverage of feature space, Mean Squared Shortest Distance (MSSD) measuring spatial coverage, and error in the estimated mean e. In designs b and bc four covariates were used as balancing variables. In bc the four covariates and the spatial coordinates were used as spreading variables. With lh the total sample size was random, but the size fluctuations were acceptable. Design lh clearly scored best with regard to U, but had by far the largest variance of e. Based on U and MSSD design bc outperformed design b, which can be explained by the use of spreading variables in bc. The variance of e for these designs was about 0.8 times the variance for simple random sampling. Using the ratio estimator for lh this variance ratio was about 1.8, showing the poor estimation performance of lh.},

abstract = {The increase in digital soil mapping around the world means that appropriate
and efficient sampling strategies are needed for validation. Data
used for calibrating a digital soil mapping model typically are non-random
samples. In such a case we recommend collection of additional independent
data and validation of the soil map by a design-based sampling strategy
involving probability sampling and design-based estimation of quality
measures. An important advantage over validation by data-splitting
or cross-validation is that model-free estimates of the quality measures
and their standard errors can be obtained, and thus no assumptions
on the spatial auto-correlation of prediction errors need to be made.
The quality of quantitative soil maps can be quantified by the spatial
cumulative distribution function (SCDF) of the prediction errors,
whereas for categorical soil maps the overall purity and the map
unit purities (user's accuracies) and soil class representation (producer's
accuracies) are suitable quality measures. The suitability of five
basic types of random sampling design for soil map validation was
evaluated: simple, stratified simple, systematic, cluster and two-stage
random sampling. Stratified simple random sampling is generally a
good choice: it is simple to implement, estimation of the quality
measures and their precision is straightforward, it gives relatively
precise estimates, and no assumptions are needed in quantifying the
standard error of the estimated quality measures. Validation by probability
sampling is illustrated with two case studies. A categorical soil
map on point support depicting soil classes in the province of Drenthe
of the Netherlands (268 000 ha) was validated by stratified simple
random sampling. Sub-areas with different expected purities were
used as strata. The estimated overall purity was 58{\%} with a standard
error of 4{\%}. This was 9{\%} smaller than the theoretical purity computed
with the model. Map unit purities and class representations were
estimated by the ratio estimator. A quantitative soil map, depicting
the average soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of pixels in an area
of 81 600 ha in Senegal, was validated by random transect sampling.
SOC predictions were seriously biased, and the random error was considerable.
Both case studies underpin the importance of independent validation
of soil maps by probability sampling, to avoid unfounded trust in
visually attractive maps produced by advanced pedometric techniques.},

abstract = {We modelled the distribution of soil properties across the agricultural zone on the Australian continent using data mining and knowledge discovery from databases (DM{\&}KDD) tools. Piecewise linear tree models were built choosing from 19 climate variables, digital elevation model (DEM) and derived terrain attributes, four Landsat multi-spectral scanner (MSS) bands, land use and lithology maps as predictors of topsoil and subsoil pH, organic C, {\%} clay, and total N and P. The actual geographic location of the sampled soil data points was not used as a predictor. Classification trees were used to estimate topsoil and subsoil horizon thickness and texture class using similar predictors. That maps could be made using the decision tree models attests to the occurrence of knowledge discovery from the soil point databases used as training data. The decision tree models were evaluated and interpreted in a spatial context by: (1) tabulation of variables selected by the tree models; (2) mapping of the extent over which individual predictors were used and their thresholds; and (3) mapping of the extent over which combinations of predictors were used. The evaluation and interpretation process indicates that the models are consistent with general principles of soil genesis and that detailed investigation of the models' structure in a spatial context may have other uses in biogeographical studies and geo-ecological process modelling. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Effective soil management requires knowledge of the spatial patterns
of soil variation within the landscape to enable wise land use decisions.
This is typically obtained through time-consuming and costly surveys.
The aim of this study was to develop a cost-efficient methodology
for digital soil mapping in poorly-accessible areas. The methodology
uses a spatial model calibrated on the basis of limited soil sampling
and explanatory covariables related to soil-forming factors, developed
from readily available secondary information from accessible areas.
The model is subsequently applied in the poorly-accessible areas.
This can only be done if the environmental conditions in the poorly-accessible
areas are also found in the accessible areas in which the model is
developed. This study illustrates the methodology in an exercise
to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in the Limpopo
National Park, Mozambique. Readily-available secondary data was used
as explanatory variables representing the soil-forming factors. Conditions
in the accessible and poorly-accessible areas corresponded sufficiently
to allow the extrapolation of the spatial model into the latter.
The spatial variation of SOC in the accessible area was mostly described
by the sampling cluster (71.5{\%}) and the landscape unit (46.3{\%}). Therefore
ordinary (punctual) kriging (OK) and kriging with external drift
(KED) based on the landscape unit were used to predict SOC. A linear
regression (LM) model using only landscape stratification was used
as control. All models were independently validated with test sets
collected in both accessible and poorly-accessible areas. In the
former the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.42–0.50{\%}
SOC. The ratio between the RMSEP in the poorly-accessible and accessible
areas was 0.67–0.72, showing that the methodology can be applied
to predict SOC in poorly-accessible areas as successful as in accessible
areas. The methodology is thus recommended for areas with similar
access problems, especially for baseline studies and for sample design
in two-stage surveys.},

abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are fundamental in assessing soil variability and are regularly used in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as a scale benchmark for all the other environmental covariates. They are conventionally used at their original grid resolution with a conventional 3??3 window size for the computation of the derived terrain attributes. The choice of scale frames the analysis and shapes the end result suggesting that better attention and quantitative knowledge of scale may improve predictive performance. Previous studies have shown the influence of pixel size but have not investigated in detail the interacting effect between window and pixel sizes. The aim of this study was to examine the scale dependency of soil classification performance at the landscape scale using two machine-learning techniques commonly applied in DSM: artificial neural networks and random forest. These were applied in three different areas in terms of their geomorphology and soil type located in Ireland. A series of DEMs representing different scales were created from the original 20m DEM by smoothing and re-sampling it with different window and pixel sizes for a total of 143 combinations: the original, 10 smoothed but not re-sampled, 12 re-sampled and not smoothed, and 120 smoothed and re-sampled. These were used to generate 11 terrain parameters from which 4 points per km2 were randomly extracted and used to predict soil classes. The overall prediction accuracy in the three study areas varied between 35{\%} and 60{\%}. Pixel size was found significant in all areas, the interaction between window and pixel sizes significant in morphologically rough areas and window size was significant only in flat homogeneous areas at coarser resolutions (above 140m in this study). In general, predictive performance was best at very fine and very coarse scales in morphologically varied areas, coarse scales in flat homogenous areas and relatively scale invariant in mixed areas. We conclude by examining whether this empirical approach is appropriate to compare scale combinations to obtain a better prediction accuracy of DSM techniques. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soils from the remote areas of the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil are poorly mapped due to the presence of dense forest and lack of access routes. The use of covariates derived from multispectral and radar remote sensors allows mapping large areas and has the potential to improve the accuracy of soil attribute maps. The objectives of this study were to: (a) evaluate the addition of relief, and vegetation covariates derived from multispectral images with distinct spatial and spectral resolutions (Landsat 8 and RapidEye) and L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) for the prediction of soil organic carbon stock (CS) and particle size fractions; and (b) evaluate the performance of four geostatistical methods to map these soil properties. Overall, the results show that, even under forest coverage, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ALOS PALSAR backscattering coefficient improved the accuracy of CS and subsurface clay content predictions. The NDVI derived from RapidEye sensor improved the prediction of CS using isotopic cokriging, while the NDVI derived from Landsat 8 and backscattering coefficient were selected to predict clay content at the subsurface using regression kriging (RK). The relative improvement of applying cokriging and RK over ordinary kriging were lower than 10{\%}, indicating that further analyses are necessary to connect soil proxies (vegetation and relief types) with soil attributes.},

abstract = {A soil survey is the main source of soil spatial information and is very useful in supporting land use decisions, especially for agronomic purposes. However, the continuity of soil surveying in Brazil has been compromised due the minimal amount of government investment in the sector. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of three data mining methods-decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN)-with R software to predict soil map units from the Guapi-Macacu watershed in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), remote sensing data (Landsat 5), and a geology map were used as predictors. Evaluation of the models' performance was based on statistical indices obtained from a confusion matrix by using validation samples. Furthermore, a comparison was performed to analyze the agreement between the maps created from the models and from a conventional soil map (legacy data); sampling locations were not used as input data in the training process. The results indicated better performance from the RF model compared with the DT and ANN models. The accuracy was calculated through validation samples indicating values in the Kappa index corresponding to 0.76 (RF), 0.72 (ANN) and 0.66 (DT). A comparison between the maps obtained from the models and the conventional soil map exhibited better agreement with the RF model (68.7{\%}), followed by the ANN (62.8{\%}), and DT (62.3{\%}) models. The classification accuracy, obtained through comparisons with sampling locations, exhibited correct classification of 57.6{\%} in the RF model, 56.8{\%} in the DT, and 56.1{\%} in the ANN model; the conventional soil map had 69.7{\%} correct classification. In general, most of the confusion between soil map units was observed in Haplic Gleysols, Haplic Acrisols (Clayic) and Fluvisols. In terms of covariates importance, in general, the terrain attributes derived from the DEM had more influence as predictor covariates than the indices obtained from the Landsat data. The application of data mining can improve the methods applied to soil map units, thereby contributing to increasing information related to soil-landscape relationships and enhancing the products of soil surveys.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to evaluate the artificial neural networks and the maximum likelihood classification performances to classify land uses at Vi{\c{c}}osa, Minas Gerais State, using ASTER images in order to verify degradation levels of pastures. In this study, three different levels of pasture degradation have been identified (moderate, strong and very strong) and an image composition of 3 bands was tested (covering the visible and the near infra-red) with 15 m of spatial resolution. The neural networks simulator used was the “Neural Java Network Simulator”, with a feed forward model and the learning algorithm of back propagation. The obtained results show that the classification using neural networks, while presenting a slightly superior result, had a statistically similar performance compared to the maximum likelihood, getting a Kappa index of 0.80, against 0.79, respectively. In relation to individual performances, the class that presented the greatest error of classification was pasture in the level of very strong degradation, while the largest accuracy in the classification was obtained for coffee, for both classifiers, with 100 and 96{\%} (respectively, Maxver and neural networks).},

abstract = {The quantification and the spatialisation of reliable SOC stocks (Mg C ha− 1) and total stock (Tg C) baselines and associated uncertainties are fundamental to detect the gains or losses in SOC, and to locate sensitive areas with low SOC levels. Here, we aim to both quantify and spatialize SOC stocks at regional scale (southern Belgium) based on data from one non-design-based or model-based sampling scheme. To this end, we developed a computation procedure based on Digital Soil Mapping techniques and stochastic simulations (Monte-Carlo) allowing the estimation of multiple (here, 10,000) independent spatialized datasets. The computation of the prediction uncertainty accounts for the errors associated to both the estimations of i) SOC stocks and ii) parameters of the spatial model. Based on these 10,000 individuals, median SOC stocks and 90{\%} prediction intervals were computed for each pixel, as well as total SOC stocks and their 90{\%} prediction intervals for selected sub-areas and for the entire study area. Hence, a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) explaining 69.3{\%} of the SOC stock variance was calibrated and then validated (R2 = 0.64). The model overestimated low SOC stock (below 50 Mg C ha− 1) and underestimated high SOC stock (especially those above 100 Mg C kg− 1). A positive gradient of SOC stock occurred from the northwest to the center of Wallonia with a slight decrease on the southernmost part, correlating to the evolution of precipitation and temperature (along with elevation) and dominant land use. At the catchment scale higher SOC stocks were predicted on valley bottoms, especially for poorly drained soils under grassland. Mean predicted SOC stocks for cropland and grassland in Wallonia were of 26.58 Tg C (SD 1.52) and 43.30 Tg C (2.93), respectively. The procedure developed here allowed to predict realistic spatial patterns of SOC stocks all over agricultural lands of southern Belgium and to produce reliable statistics of total SOC stocks for each of the 20 combinations of land use/agricultural regions of Wallonia. This procedure appears useful to produce soil maps as policy tools in conducting sustainable management at regional and national scales, and to compute statistics which comply with specific requirements of reporting activities.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyse the effects of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution on the results of a model that simulates spatially explicit relative shallow landslide hazard and soil redistribution patterns and quantities. We analyse distributions of slope, specific catchment area and relative hazard for shallow landsliding for four different DEM resolutions (grid sizes of 10, 25, 50 and 100 m) of a 12 km2 study area in northern New Zealand. The effect of DEM resolution is especially pronounced for the boundary conditions determining a valid hazard calculation. For coarse resolutions, the smoothing effect results in a larger area becoming classified as unconditionally stable or unstable. We apply simple empirical soil redistribution algorithms for scenarios in which all sites with a certain landslide hazard fail and generate debris flow. The lower initial number of failing cells but also the inclusion of slope (limit) in those algorithms becomes apparent with coarser resolutions. For finer resolutions, much larger amounts of soil redistribution are found, which is attributed to the more detailed landscape representation. Looking at spatial patterns of landslide erosion and sedimentation, the size of the area affected by these processes also increases with finer resolutions. In general, landslide erosion occupies larger parts of the area than deposition, although the total amounts of soil material eroded and deposited are the same. Analysis of feedback mechanisms between soil failures over time shows that finer resolutions show higher percentages of the area with an increased or decreased landslide hazard. When the extent of sites with lower and higher hazards are compared, finer grid sizes and higher landslide hazard threshold scenarios tend to increase the total extent of areas becoming more stable relative to the less stable ones. Extreme care should be taken when quantifying landslide basin sediment yield by applying simple soil redistribution formulas to DEMs with different resolutions. Rather, quantities should be interpreted as relative amounts. For studying shallow landsliding over a longer timeframe, the 'perfect' DEM resolution may not exist, because no resolution can possibly represent the dimensions of all different slope failures scattered in space and time. We assert that the choice of DEM resolution, possibly restricted by data availability in the first place, should always be adapted to the context of a particular type of analysis.

abstract = {One of the fundamental assumptions underlying linear regression models is that the errors have a constant variance (i.e., homoscedastic). When this assumption is violated, standard errors from a regression can be biased and inconsistent, meaning that the associated p values and 95{\%} confidence intervals cannot be trusted. The assumption of homoscedasticity is made for statistical reasons rather than biological reasons; in most real datasets, some form of heteroscedasticity is likely to exist. However, a survey of the behavioural ecology literature showed that only about 5{\%} of articles explicitly mentioned heteroscedasticity, leaving 95{\%} of articles in which heteroscedasticity was apparently absent. These results strongly indicate that the prevalence of heteroscedasticity is widely under-reported within behavioural ecology. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of heteroscedasticity amongst behavioural ecologists. Using topical examples from fields in behavioural ecology such as sexual dimorphism and animal personality, we highlight the biological importance of considering heteroscedasticity. We also emphasize that researchers should pay closer attention to the variance in their data and consider what factors could cause heteroscedasticity. In addition, we introduce some simple methods of dealing with heteroscedasticity. The two methods we focus on are: (1) incorporating variance functions within a generalised least squares (GLS) framework to model the functional form of heteroscedasticity and; (2) heteroscedasticity-consistent standard error (HCSE) estimators, which can be used when the functional form of heteroscedasticity is unknown. Using case studies, we show how both methods can influence the output from linear regression models. Finally, we hope that more researchers will consider heteroscedasticity as an important source of additional information about the particular biological process being studied, rather than an impediment to statistical analysis.},

abstract = {We review and give a practical example of Latin hypercube sampling in soil science using an approach we call flexible Latin hypercube sampling. Recent studies of soil properties in large and remote regions have highlighted problems with the conventional Latin hypercube sampling approach. It is often impractical to travel far from tracks and roads to collect samples, and survey planning should recognise this fact. Another problem is how to handle target sites that, for whatever reason, are impractical to sample - should one just move on to the next target or choose something in the locality that is accessible? Working within a Latin hypercube that spans the covariate space, selecting an alternative site is hard to do optimally. We propose flexible Latin hypercube sampling as a means of avoiding these problems. Flexible Latin hypercube sampling involves simulated annealing for optimally selecting accessible sites from a region. The sampling protocol also produces an ordered list of alternative sites close to the primary target site, should the primary target site prove inaccessible. We highlight the use of this design through a broad-scale sampling exercise in the Burdekin catchment of north Queensland, Australia. We highlight the robustness of our design through a simulation study where up to 50{\%} of target sites may be inaccessible. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {The System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) is an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS), mainly licensed under the GNU General Public License. Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular organized software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, an easily approachable graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to scripting and low level programming languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 700 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Further, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to analyse RapidEye satellite image characteristics, as well as to assess its orthorectification geometric accuracy and its application for land use mapping, in a rugged landscape. An atmospheric correction was applied to the images, which was followed by the assessment of the following aspects: spectral response to different targets in the uncorrected and corrected images; accuracy of the orthorectified image; and accuracy of the supervised classification. The atmospheric correction allowed a better evaluation of the spectral response of the targets. The geometrical evaluation according to the Map Accuracy Standards, classified the orthorectified image in class C at the 1:20,000 scale. The supervised classification consistently quantified the areas and the percentage of each soil use class. The distribution of classes highlights the historical effect of the use on land degradation},

Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent.

This study combined ecological measures of off-trail resource impacts with social science techniques to understand visitor judgments of ecological impacts and visitors' degree of expo- sure to impacts. Specifically, this paper reports on a novel integration of techniques thatwas tested in the Bear Lake Road Corridor of Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA in which resource change, as a result of visitor use off designated trails and sites, was assessed and combined with social science and visitor use data. Visual survey techniques were used to understand visitor judgments of ecologically important resource impacts and GPS-tracking of visitor use and behavior allowed for the determination of the degree of visitor's exposure to impaired resources. Results suggest that resource impacts are prevalent and intense throughout the area, but tended to be spatially limited in proximity to attraction sites. Visitors are interacting with resource conditions reported to be unacceptable for significant portions of their hikes. Overall, the work represents an advancement of predictive capabilities when managing park and protected area resources.},

abstract = {Summary: There is an increasing demand for up-to-date soil organic carbon (OC) data for global environmental and climatic modelling. The aim of this study was to create a map of topsoil OC content at the European scale by applying digital soil mapping techniques to the first European harmonized geo-referenced topsoil (0-20 cm) database, which arises from the Land use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS). A map of the associated uncertainty was also produced to support careful use of the predicted OC contents. A generalized additive model (GAM) was fitted on 85{\%} of the dataset (R2 = 0.29), using OC content as dependent variable a backward stepwise approach selected slope, land cover, temperature, net primary productivity, latitude and longitude as suitable covariates. The validation of the model (performed on 15{\%} of the data-set) gave an overall R2 of 0.27 and an R2 of 0.21 for mineral soils and 0.06 for organic soils. Organic C content in most organic soils was under-predicted, probably because of the imposed unimodal distribution of our model, whose mean is tilted towards the prevalent mineral soils. This was also confirmed by the poor prediction in Scandinavia (where organic soils are more frequent), which gave an R2 of 0.09, whilst the prediction performance (R2) in non-Scandinavian countries was 0.28. The map of predicted OC content had the smallest values in Mediterranean countries and in croplands across Europe, whereas largest OC contents were predicted in wetlands, woodlands and mountainous areas. The map of the predictions' standard error had large uncertainty in northern latitudes, wetlands, moors and heathlands, whereas small uncertainty was mostly found in croplands. The map produced gives the most updated general picture of topsoil OC content at the European Union scale. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Understanding the linkages between structure and processes in soil landscapes involves analyses across several spatial and temporal scales. The transfer of information between scales requires the (1) identification of respective scale levels and (2) procedures for regionalization. Here, we present a multiparameter delineation of landform units and their attribution with typical Reference Soil Groups (RSG) of a landscape of NE Germany which is representative of young moraine regions. Data sources are a digital elevation model (DEM, 5 m x 5 m), a reference data set from sections of an intensively augered landscape, and expert knowledge. A conceptual digital soil map was constructed in the scale 1: 5000 based on the Topographic Position Index (TPI). The methodology is applicable for multiscale analyses. Results are (1) the landform unit classified by digital terrain analysis of a DEM, (2) the attribution of RSG, and (3) the evaluation of the classification. Accuracy of the method was 57{\%} overall, with 70{\%} accuracy on typical erosional sites. The developed method allows identification of terrain-related soil pattern with high spatial resolution in glacial-drift areas. The high resolution of soil information can be used for delineation of management zones in precision farming, or as input for process studies and models requiring a translation of typological soil information into relevant soil properties (e. g., by pedotransfer functions).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection. RESULTS: We investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy. CONCLUSION: Because of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data.},

abstract = {Quantitative estimates of forage availability at the end of the growing season in rangelands are helpful for pastoral livestock managers and for local, national and regional stakeholders in natural resource management. For this reason, remote sensing data such as the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) have been widely used to assess Sahelian plant productivity for about 40 years. This study combines traditional FAPAR-based assessments with agrometeorological variables computed by the geospatial water balance program, GeoWRSI, using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration satellite gridded data to estimate the annual herbaceous yield in the semi-arid areas of Senegal. It showed that a machine-learning model combining FAPAR seasonal metrics with various agrometeorological data provided better estimations of the in situ annual herbaceous yield (R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 483 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) than models based exclusively on FAPAR metrics (R2 = 0.63; RMSE = 550 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) or agrometeorological variables (R2 = 0.55; RMSE = 585 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha). All the models provided reasonable outputs and showed a decrease in the mean annual yield with increasing latitude, together with an increase in relative inter-annual variation. In particular, the additional use of agrometeorological information mitigated the saturation effects that characterize the plant indices of areas with high plant productivity. In addition, the date of the onset of the growing season derived from smoothed FAPAR seasonal dynamics showed no significant relationship (0.05 p-level) with the annual herbaceous yield across the whole studied area. The date of the onset of rainfall however, was significantly related to the herbaceous yield and its inclusion in fodder biomass models could constitute a significant improvement in forecasting risks of a mass herbaceous deficit at an early stage of the year.

abstract = {Proximal sensing provides an alternative method to physical and chemical laboratory soil analyses. The aim of this study is to predict soil organic carbon (SOC), clay, sand, and silt content using reduced spectral features as covariables selected by two spectral preprocessing. A total of 299 soil samples were collected in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Two preprocessing techniques, detrend transformation and continuum removal (CR), were applied to isolate particular absorption features in the reflectance spectrum. Two techniques were used to select the spectral features in the spectrum: hand and mathematical selection. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Support vector machines (SVM) were applied to predict the soil properties. The reduction of predictor covariables by hand selection technique contributed in developing a high-level prediction model for SOC. PLSR and SVM presented no statistical difference between the RMSE results, except for clay content, where SVM presented superior performance. The preprocessing techniques were statistically identical based on RMSE results. Overall, the prediction of SOC, clay, sand and silt presented suitable results using reduced spectral features as covariables in modeling process.},

abstract = {Spatial information on soil properties is an important input to hydrological models. In current hydrological modelling practices, soil property information is often derived from soil category maps by the linking method in which a representative soil property value is linked to each soil polygon. Limited by the area-class nature of soil category maps, the derived soil property variation is discontinuous and less detailed than high resolution digital terrain or remote sensing data. This research proposed dmSoil, a data-mining-based approach to derive continuous and spatially detailed soil property information from soil category maps. First, the soil-environment relationships are extracted through data mining of a soil map. The similarity of the soil at each location to different soil types in the soil map is then estimated using the mined relationships. Prediction of soil property values at each location is made by combining the similarities of the soil at that location to different soil types and the representative soil property values of these soil types. The new approach was applied in the Raffelson Watershed and Pleasant Valley in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, United States to map soil A horizon texture (in both areas) and depth to soil C horizon (in Pleasant Valley). The property maps from the dmSoil approach capture the spatial gradation and details of soil properties better than those from the linking method. The new approach also shows consistent accuracy improvement at validation points. In addition to the improved performances, the inputs for the dmSoil approach are easy to prepare, and the approach itself is simple to deploy. It provides an effective way to derive better soil property information from soil category maps for hydrological modelling. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Area-pedodiversity, area–vegetation diversity, area-bioclimatic belts, diversity and pedodiversity-vegetation diversity-bioclimatic diversity relationships were analyzed for the most arid region of Western Europe (SE Spain). The study is novel in that it analyzed these relationships using as operational geographic units (OGUs) the set of polygons belonging to the same character state (i.e., typology) that defines a zone in a given thematic map. We considered three thematic maps: 1) the map of soil associations (SMU) with 303 different soil associations (i.e., 303 areas or zones); 2) the map of potential vegetation (PNV) with 40 vegetation series or zones and 3) the map of bioclimatic belts (BB) with 7 bioclimatic zones. Using GIS tools, we analyzed the contents (richness) of soil mapping units (polygons) with regard to vegetation series and bioclimatic belts as well as the contents of vegetation series and bioclimatic belts with regard to SMU. The results indicate that the relationships between the area and the richness of zones follow a power law, the “fingerprint of fractal geometry”, irrespective of the way the area has been defined and their relative magnitude (the areas defined by SMU are the smallest, while the areas defined by bioclimatic belts are the largest). The results also indicate a significant correlation between the $\alpha$ diversities of the zones and between their $\beta$ diversities. We conclude that the methods used to measure such correlations, based on $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversities are useful to investigate and quantify the relationships between the pedosphere, vegetation and climate.},

abstract = {Soil compaction is a key impacts related to opening and running trails. The decrease in the size of the pores of the soil can trigger other impacts such as erosion, and the bed of the trail and its surroundings as a backdrop. This paper attempts to show the difference between the rates of compaction checked in and out of a trail located in the Serra do Cip{\'{o}} National Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The trail is the most investigated used for the practice of ecotourism and recreational activities. We used a cone penetrometer with ring dynamometer for determining rates of soil compaction between 0 and 15 cm deep, at points equally spaced at 200 m along the trail known as the Farofa Trail. The results indicate a significant difference in rates penetrometer in and out of the trail bed investigated. These indexes suggest that the Farofa Trail as well as other trails nearby, have the necessary conditions for the establishment of various impacts related to compaction of the soil surface.

abstract = {We investigated two approaches for large-scale analysis and prediction of the spatial distribution of soil properties in an agricultural landscape in the Canadian prairies. The first approach was based on the implementation of nine types of digital terrain models (DTMs) and regression analysis of soil and topographic data. The second approach used a concept of accumulation, transit, and dissipation zones of the landsurface. Soil properties were soil moisture, residual phosphorus, solum thickness, depth to calcium carbonate, and organic carbon content. The dependence of soil properties on topography was supported by correlations for the upper soil layer. However, topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus decreased with depth. Also, correlation coefficients and regression equations describing topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus differed among seasons. This imposes limitations on regression-based predictions of the spatial distribution of soil properties. The prediction of soil property distribution with the concept of accumulation, transit and dissipation zones can be more successful and appropriate than the prediction based on linear regression. The variability in relationships between soil and topographic characteristics with depth may stem from spatial variability in the rate of decline of hydraulic conductivity with depth. Temporal variability in soil–topography relationships occurs because soil properties result from interactions of a variety of pedogenetic factors and processes marked by different temporal variability. In soil studies with digital terrain modelling, there is a need to take into account four types of variability in relations between soil and relief: regional, temporal, depth, and scale.},

abstract = {The central problem of a combined analysis of digital terrain models (DTMs) and other landscape data is determination of a DTM grid size (w) providing a correct study of relationships between topographic variables and landscape properties. Generally, an ‘adequate' w is determined by an expert estimate, and solutions are largely subjective. We developed an experimental statistical method to determine an adequate w for DTMs applied to landscape studies. The method includes the following steps: (a) derivation of a DTM set using a series ofwi, (b) performance of a correlation analysis of data on a landscape property and a topographic variable estimated with various wi , (c) plotting of correlation coe? cients obtained versus w, and (d) determination of smoothed plot portions indicating intervals of an adequate w.We applied the method developed to study the in? uence of topography on the spatial distribution of soil moisture (M) at a micro-scale. We investigated the dependence of M on gradient (G), horizontal (kh), vertical (kv), and mean (H) landsurface curvatures. For DTM derivation, we used 13 values of wi from 1 to 7m. An interval of adequate wi for M falls between 2.25 and 3.25m in the given terrain conditions. In absolute magnitudes, correlation coe? cients are largest within this interval; correlation coe? cients of M with G, kh, kv and H are {\~{O}} 0.28, {\~{O}} 0.52, {\~{O}} 0.50 and {\~{O}} 0.60, respectively, for w5 3m. The results obtained demonstrate that the method actu- ally works to identify an adequate w at a micro-scale. The method developed allows estimation of an adequate area of landform which ‘realise' a topographic control of landscape properties.},

abstract = {Accurate and detailed spatial soil information is essential for environmental modelling, risk assessment and decision making. The use of Remote Sensing data as secondary sources of information in digital soil mapping has been found to be cost effective and less time consuming compared to traditional soil mapping approaches. But the potentials of Remote Sensing data in improving knowledge of local scale soil information in West Africa have not been fully explored. This study investigated the use of high spatial resolution satellite data (RapidEye and Landsat), terrain/climatic data and laboratory analysed soil samples to map the spatial distribution of six soil properties–sand, silt, clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen–in a 580 km2 agricultural watershed in south-western Burkina Faso. Four statistical prediction models–multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB)–were tested and compared. Internal validation was conducted by cross validation while the predictions were validated against an independent set of soil samples considering the modelling area and an extrapolation area. Model performance statistics revealed that the machine learning techniques performed marginally better than the MLR, with the RFR providing in most cases the highest accuracy. The inability of MLR to handle non-linear relationships between dependent and independent variables was found to be a limitation in accurately predicting soil properties at unsampled locations. Satellite data acquired during ploughing or early crop development stages (e.g. May, June) were found to be the most important spectral predictors while elevation, temperature and precipitation came up as prominent terrain/climatic variables in predicting soil properties. The results further showed that shortwave infrared and near infrared channels of Landsat8 as well as soil specific indices of redness, coloration and saturation were prominent predictors in digital soil mapping. Considering the increased availability of freely available Remote Sensing data (e.g. Landsat, SRTM, Sentinels), soil information at local and regional scales in data poor regions such as West Africa can be improved with relatively little financial and human resources.

abstract = {The paper describes a framework for modeling dynamic soil properties in 3-dimensions and time (3D + T) using soil data collected with automated sensor networks as a case study. Two approaches to geostatistical modeling and spatio-temporal predictions are described: (1) 3D + T predictive modeling using random forests algorithms, and (2) 3D + T kriging model after detrending the observations for depth-dependent seasonal effects. All the analyses used data from the Cook Agronomy Farm (37 ha), which includes hourly measurements of soil volumetric water content, temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity at 42 stations and five depths (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m), collected over five years. This data set also includes 2- and 3-dimensional, temporal, and spatio-temporal covariates covering the same area. The results of (strict) leave-one-station-out cross-validation indicate that both models accurately predicted soil temperature, while predictive power was lower for water content, and lowest for electrical conductivity. The kriging model explained 37{\%}, 96{\%}, and 18{\%} of the variability in water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity respectively versus 34{\%}, 93{\%}, and 5{\%} explained by the random forests model. A less rigorous simple cross-validation of the random forests model indicated improved predictive power when at least some data were available for each station, explaining 86{\%}, 97{\%}, and 88{\%} of the variability in water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity respectively. The high difference between the strict and simple cross-validation indicates high temporal auto-correlation of values at measurement stations. Temporal model components (i.e. day of the year and seasonal trends) explained most of the variability in observations in both models for all three variables. The seamless predictions of 3D + T data produced from this analysis can assist in understanding soil processes and how they change through a season, under different land management scenarios, and how they relate to other environmental processes.},

abstract = {Mountain tourism in developing countries is becoming a growing environmental concern due to extreme seasonality, lack of suitable infrastructures and planning, and interference with fragile ecosystems and protected areas. This paper presents a study devoted to assess the adverse environmental impacts of tourism, and in particular of trekking-related activities, in Ladakh, Indian Himalaya. The proposed approach is based on the use of Geographical Information System (GIS) modeling and remote sensing imageries to cope with the lack of data that affect the region. First, stressors associated with trekking, and environmental receptors potentially affected were identified. Subsequently, a baseline study on stressors (trail use, waste dumping, camping, pack animal grazing and off-road driving) and receptors (soil, water, wildlife, vegetation) was conducted through field work, data collection, and data processing supported by GIS. Finally, impacts were modeled by considering the intensity of the stressors, and the vulnerability and the value of the receptors. The results were spatially aggregated into watershed units, and combined to generate composite impact maps. The study concluded that the most affected watersheds are located in the central and southeastern part of Ladakh, along some of the most visited trails and within the Hemis and the Tsokar Tsomoriri National parks. The main objective of the study was to understand patterns of tourism-induced environmental degradation, so as to support mitigation interventions, as well as the development of suitable tourism policies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Many conservation and restoration efforts in developed countries are increasingly based on the premise of recognising and stimulating more ‘multi- functionality' in agricultural landscapes. Public pol- icy making is often a pragmatic process that involves efforts to negotiate trade-offs between the potentially conflicting demands of various stakeholders. Conser- vationists' efforts to influence policy making, can therefore benefit from any tool that will help them to identify other socio-economic functions or values that coincide with good ecological conservation options. Various types of socio-economic objectives have in recent years been mapped across landscapes and so there are now important opportunities to explore the spatial heterogeneity of these diverse functions across the wider landscape in search of potential spatial synergies, i.e. ‘multiple win locations' or multifunc- tional ‘hotspots'. This paper explores the potential occurrence of such synergies within the agricultural landscape of northeast Scotland and evaluates an existing woodland planting policy using and combining three different policy objectives. Our results show that there are indeed broad areas of the studied landscape where multiple objec- tives (biodiversity, visual amenity and on-site recrea- tion potential) could be achieved simultaneously (hotspots), and that the case study which we evaluate (the FarmWoodland Premium Scheme) could be much better spatially targeted with regards to each individual objective as well as with regards to these hotspots of multifunctionality.},

abstract = {Random Forests are considered for classification of multisource remote sensing and geographic data. Various ensemble classification methods have been proposed in recent years. These methods have been proven to improve classification accuracy considerably. The most widely used ensemble methods are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known ensemble methods on multisource remote sensing and geographic data. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved. Computer models have been used to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change. Commonly, models require to determine soil bulk density (D b ), a variable that is often lacking in soil data bases. To partly overcome this problem, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are developed to estimate D b from other easily available soil properties. However, only a few studies have determined the accuracy of these functions and quantified their effects on the final quality of the spatial variability maps. In this context, the objectives of this study were: i) to develop one PTF to estimate D b in soils of the Brazilian Central Amazon region; ii) to compare the performance of PTFs generated with three other models generally used to estimate D b in soils of the Amazon region; and iii) to quantify the effect of applying these PTFs on the spatial variability maps of SOC stock. Using data from 96 soil profiles in the Urucu river basin in Brazil, a multiple linear regression model was generated to estimate D b using SOC, pH, sum of basic cations, aluminum (Al +3 ), and clay content. This model outperformed the three other PTFs published in the literature. The average estimation error of SOC stock using our model was 0.03 Mg C ha -1 , which is markedly lower than the other PTFs (1.06 and 1.23 Mg C ha -1 , or 15 {\%} and 17 {\%}, respectively). Thus, the application of a non-validated PTF to estimate D b can introduce an error that is large enough to skew the significant difference in soil carbon stock change.},

abstract = {Spatial estimates of tropical soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and stocks are crucial to understanding the role of tropical SOC in the global carbon cycle. They also allow for spatial variation of SOC in environmental process models. SOC is spatially highly variable. In traditional approaches, SOC concentrations and stocks have been derived from estimates for single or very few profiles and spatially linked to existing units of soil or vegetation maps. However, many existing soil profile data are incomplete and untested as to whether they are representative or unbiased. Also single means for soil or vegetation map units cannot characterize SOC spatial variability within these units. We here use the digital soil mapping approach to predict the spatial distribution of SOC. This relies on a soil inference model based on spatially referenced environmental layers of topographic attributes, soil units, parent material, and forest history. We sampled soils at 165 sites, stratified according to topography and lithology, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, at depths of 0-10??cm, 10-20??cm, 20-30??cm, and 30-50??cm, and analyzed them for SOC by dry combustion. We applied Random Forest (RF) analysis as a modeling tool to the SOC data for each depth interval in order to compare vertical and lateral distribution patterns. RF has several advantages compared to other modeling approaches, for instance, the fact that it is neither sensitive to overfitting nor to noise features. The RF-based digital SOC mapping approach provided SOC estimates of high spatial resolution and estimates of error and predictor importance. The environmental variables that explained most of the variation in the topsoil (0-10??cm) were topographic attributes. In the subsoil (10-50??cm), SOC distribution was best explained by soil texture classes as derived from soil mapping units. The estimates for SOC stocks in the upper 30??cm ranged between 38 and 116??Mg ha- 1, with lowest stocks on midslope and highest on toeslope positions. This digital soil mapping approach can be applied to similar landscapes to refine the spatial resolution of SOC estimates. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The history of digital soil mapping and modeling (DSMM) is marked by adoption of new mapping tools and techniques, data management systems, innovative delivery of soil data, and methods to analyze, integrate, and visualize soil and environmental datasets. DSMM studies are diverse with specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local, national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soil-centered, but consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two high-impact international soil science journals - Geoderma and Soil Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space. The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v) distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix) quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method. Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be operationalized in soil mapping/modeling programs, research gaps, and future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties, quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be ideally in balance. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in soil fertility and C cycle. Detailed information about the spatial distribution of SOM is vital to effective management of soil fertility and better understanding of the process of C cycle. To date, however, few studies have been carried out to digitally map the spatial variation of SOM for rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation at the regional scale in Hainan Island, China. In this study, a hybrid approach, random forest plus residuals kriging (RFRK), was proposed to predict and map the spatial pattern of SOM for the rubber plantation. A total of 2511 topsoil (0-20cm) samples were extracted from a soil fertility survey data set of the Danzhou County. These soil samples were randomly divided into calibration dataset (1757 soil samples) and validation dataset (754 soil samples). In this study, stepwise linear regression (SLR), random forest (RF), and random forest plus residuals kriging (RFRK) were used to predict and map the spatial distribution of SOM for the rubber plantation, while generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) and classification and regression tree (CART) were employed to uncover relationships between SOM and environmental variables and further to identify the main factors influencing SOM variation. The RFRK model was developed to predict spatial variability of SOM on the basis of terrain attributes, geological units, climate factors, and vegetation index. Performance of RFRK was compared with SLR. Mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were selected as comparison criteria. Results showed that RFRK performed much better than SLR in predicting and mapping the spatial distribution of SOM for the rubber plantation. The RFRK model had much lower prediction errors (ME, MAE, and RMSE) and higher R2 than SLR. Values of ME, MAE, RMSE, and R2 were 0.26g/kg, 1.35g/kg, 2.19g/kg, and 0.86 for RFRK model, and were 0.65g/kg, 2.99g/kg, 4.37g/kg, and 0.43 for SLR equation, respectively. Moreover, RFRK model yielded a more realistic spatial distribution of SOM than SLR equation. The good performance of RFRK model could be ascribed to its capabilities of dealing with non-linear and hierarchical relationships between SOM and environmental variables and of accounting for unexplained information in the random forest (RF) model residuals. These results suggested that RFRK was a promising approach in predicting spatial distribution of SOM for rubber plantation at regional scale. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = { Statistical classification of byperspectral data is challenging because the inputs are high in dimension and represent multiple classes that are sometimes quite mixed, while the amount and quality of ground truth in the form of labeled data is typically limited. The resulting classifiers are often unstable and have poor generalization. This work investigates two approaches based on the concept of random forests of classifiers implemented within a binary hierarchical multiclassifier system, with the goal of achieving improved generalization of the classifier in analysis of hyperspectral data, particularly when the quantity of training data is limited. A new classifier is proposed that incorporates bagging of training samples and adaptive random subspace feature selection within a binary hierarchical classifier (BHC), such that the number of features that is selected at each node of the tree is dependent on the quantity of associated training data. Results are compared to a random forest implementation based on the framework of classification and regression trees. For both methods, classification results obtained from experiments on data acquired by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer instrument over the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and by Hyperion on the NASA Earth Observing 1 satellite over the Okavango Delta of Botswana are superior to those from the original best basis BHC algorithm and a random subspace extension of the BHC.},

abstract = {Random Forests are frequently applied as they achieve a high prediction accuracy and have the ability to identify informative variables. Several approaches for variable selection have been proposed to combine and intensify these qualities. An extensive review of the corresponding literature led to the development of a new approach that is based on the theoretical framework of permutation tests and meets important statistical properties. A comparison to another eight popular variable selection methods in three simulation studies and four real data applications indicated that: the new approach can also be used to control the test-wise and family-wise error rate, provides a higher power to distinguish relevant from irrelevant variables and leads to models which are located among the very best performing ones. In addition, it is equally applicable to regression and classification problems. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge on the spatial distribution of soils is crucial for environmental monitoring, management, and modeling. However soil maps with a finite number of discrete soil map units are often the only available information about soils. Depending on the map scale or the detailing of the map legend this information could be too imprecise. We present a method for the spatial disaggregation of map units, namely the refinement of complex soil map units in which two or more soil types are aggregated. Our aim is to draw new boundaries inside the map polygons to represent a single soil type and no longer a mixture of several soil types. The basic idea for our method is the functional relationship between soil types and topographic position as formulated in the concept of the catena. We use a comprehensive soil profile database and topographic attributes derived from a 10. m digital elevation model as input data for the classification of soil types with random forest models. We grouped all complex map units which have the same combination of soil types. Each group of map units is modeled separately. For prediction of the soil types we stratified the soil map into these groups and apply a specific random forest model only to the associated map units. In order to get reliable results we define a threshold for the predicted probabilities at 0.7 to assign a specific soil type. In areas where the probability is below 0.7 for every possible soil type we assign a new class "indifferent" because the model only makes unspecific classification there. Our results show a significant spatial refinement of the original soil polygons. Validation of our predictions was estimated on 1812 independent soil profiles which were collected subsequent to prediction in the field. Field validation gave an overall accuracy of 70{\%}. Map units, in which shallow soils were grouped together with deep soils could be separated best. Also histosols could be predicted successful. Highest error rate were found in map units, in which Gleysoils were grouped together with deep soils or Anthrosols. To check for validity of our results we open the black box random forest model by calculating the variable importance for each predictor variable and plotting response surfaces. We found good confirmations of our hypotheses, that topography has a significant influence on the spatial arrangement of soil types and that these relationships can be used for disaggregation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {80{\%} of arable land in Africa has low soil fertility and suffers from physical soil problems. Additionally, significant amounts of nutrients are lost every year due to unsustainable soil management practices. This is partially the result of insufficient use of soil management knowledge. To help bridge the soil information gap in Africa, the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project was established in 2008. Over the period 2008-2014, the AfSIS project compiled two point data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database and the AfSIS Sentinel Site database. These data sets contain over 28 thousand sampling locations and represent the most comprehensive soil sample data sets of the African continent to date. Utilizing these point data sets in combination with a large number of covariates, we have generated a series of spatial predictions of soil properties relevant to the agricultural management-organic carbon, pH, sand, silt and clay fractions, bulk density, cation-exchange capacity, total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, Al content and exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg, Na). We specifically investigate differences between two predictive approaches: random forests and linear regression. Results of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the random forests algorithm consistently outperforms the linear regression algorithm, with average decreases of 15-75{\%} in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across soil properties and depths. Fitting and running random forests models takes an order of magnitude more time and the modelling success is sensitive to artifacts in the input data, but as long as quality-controlled point data are provided, an increase in soil mapping accuracy can be expected. Results also indicate that globally predicted soil classes (USDA Soil Taxonomy, especially Alfisols and Mollisols) help improve continental scale soil property mapping, and are among the most important predictors. This indicates a promising potential for transferring pedological knowledge from data rich countries to countries with limited soil data.},

abstract = {In this study, we evaluate the application of a Random Forest (RF) classifier as a tool for understanding and predicting the complex hierarchical relationships between soil parent material and topography using a digital elevation model (DEM) and conventional soil survey maps. Single-component soil polygons from conventional soil survey maps of the Langley-Vancouver Map Area, British Columbia (Canada), were used to generate randomized training points for 9 parent material classes. Each point was intersected with values from 27 topographic indices derived from a 100m DEM. RF's mtry parameter was optimized using multiple replicates of 5-fold cross validation and parent material predictions were made for the region. Predictive parent material maps were validated through comparisons with legacy soil survey maps and 307 field points. Results show that predictions made by a non-optimized RF resulted in a kappa index of 89.6{\%} when validated with legacy soil survey data from single-component polygons and a kappa index of 79.5{\%} when validated with field data. Variable reduction and mtry optimization resulted in minimal improvements in RF predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RF as a machine learning and data mining approach; however, the need for reliable training data was highlighted by less reliable results for polygon disaggregation in portions of the map where fewer training data points could be established. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the limitations of environmental data is important for managing environmental systems effectively and for encouraging the responsible use of uncertain data. Explicit assessment of the uncertainties associated with environmental data, and their storage in a database, are therefore important. This paper presents a statistical framework for representing and simulating uncertain environmental variables. In general terms, an uncertain variable is completely specified by its probability distribution function (pdf). Pdfs are developed for objects with uncertain locations ('positional uncertainty') and uncertain attribute values ('attribute uncertainty'). Objects comprising multiple space-time locations are separated into 'rigid objects', where positional uncertainty cannot alter the internal geometry of the object, and 'deformable' objects, where positional uncertainty can vary between locations in one object. Statistical dependence is allowed between uncertainties in multiple locations in one object. The uncertainties associated with attribute values are also modelled with pdfs. The type and complexity of these pdfs depend upon the measurement scale and the space-time variability of the uncertain attribute. The framework is illustrated with examples. A prototype software tool for assessing uncertainties in environmental data, storing them within a database, and for generating realizations for use in Monte Carlo studies is also presented.},

abstract = {12 This study investigates the quality (in terms of elevation accuracy and systematic errors) of three recent 13 publicly available elevation model data sets over Australia: the 9 arc second national GEODATA DEM- 14 9S ver3 from Geoscience Australia and the Australian National University (ANU), the 3 arc second 15 SRTM ver4.1 from CGIAR-CSI, and the 1 arc second ASTER-GDEM ver1 from NASA/METI. The 16 main features of these data sets are reported from a geodetic point of view. Comparison at about 1 billion 17 locations identifies artefacts (e.g., residual cloud patterns and stripe effects) in ASTER. For DEM-9S, the 18 comparisons against the space-collected SRTM and ASTER models demonstrate that signal omission 19 (due to the {\~{}}270 m spacing) may cause errors of the order of 100-200 m in some rugged areas of 20 Australia. Based on a set of geodetic ground control points (GCPs) over Western Australia, the vertical 21 accuracy of DEM-9S is {\~{}}9 m, SRTM {\~{}}6 m and ASTER {\~{}}15 m. However, these values vary as a function 22 of the terrain type and shape. Thus, CGIAR-CSI SRTM ver4.1 may represent a viable alternative to 23 DEM-9S for some applications. While ASTER GDEM has an unprecedented horizontal resolution of 24 {\~{}}30m, systematic errors present in this research-grade version of the ASTER GDEM ver1 will impede its 25 immediate use for some applications},

abstract = {The Bocaina Plateau, which is situated on the eastern flank of the continental rift of southeastern Brazil, is the highest part of the Serra do Mar. Topographic relief in this area is suggested to be closely related to its complex tectono-magmatic evolution since the breakup of Western Gondwana and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Apatite fission track ages and track length distributions from 27 basement outcrops were determined to assess these hypotheses and reconstruct the denudation history of the Bocaina Plateau. The ages range between 303 ?? 32 and 46 ?? 5. Ma, and are significantly younger than the stratigraphic ages. Mean track lengths vary from 13.44 ?? 1.51 to 11.1 ?? 1.48 ??m, with standard deviations between 1.16 and 1.83 ??m. Contrasting ages within a single plateau and similar ages at different altitudes indicate a complex regional tectonothermal evolution. The thermal histories inferred from these data imply three periods of accelerated cooling related to the Early Cretaceous continental breakup, Early Cretaceous alkaline magmatism, and the Paleogene evolution of the continental rift of southeastern Brazil. The oldest fission track ages ({\textgreater} 200. Ma) were obtained in the Serra do Mar region, suggesting that these areas were a long-lived source of sediments for the Paran??, Bauru, and Santos basins. ?? 2010 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {Mapping and immediate forecasting of soil water content ($\theta$) and its movement can be challenging. Although inversion of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by electromagnetic induction to calculate depth-specific electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) has been used, it is difficult to apply it across a field. In this paper we use a calibration established along a transect, across a 3.94-ha field with varying soil texture, using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to monitor and nowcast the 3-dimensional $\theta$ dynamics on 16 separate days over a period of 38 days. The EnKF combined a physical model fitted with $\theta$ measured by soil moisture sensors and an Artificial Neural Network model comprising $\sigma$ generated by quasi-3d inversions of DUALEM-421S ECa data. Results showed that the distribution of $\theta$ was controlled by soil texture, topography, and vegetation. Soil water dried fastest at the beginning after the initial irrigation event and decreased with time and soil depth, which was consistent with classical soil drying theory and experiments. It was also found that the soil dried fastest in the loamy and duplex soils present in the field, which was attributable to deep drainage and preferential flow. It was concluded that the EnKF approach can be used to improve the irrigation efficiency by applying variable irrigation rates across the field. In addition, soil water status can be nowcasted across large spatial extents using this method with weather forecast information, which will provide guidance to farmers for real-time irrigation management.},

Graphically, the transformation involves a shifting of the origin of reflectance spectra plotted in NIR-red wavelength space to account for first-order soil-vegetation interactions and differential red and NIR flux extinction through vegetated canopies. For cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var DPL-70) and range grass (Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees) canopies, underlain with different soil backgrounds, the transformation nearly eliminated soil-induced variations in vegetation indices.

Current trends in digital terrain modelling are discussed. Topographical data sources and digital elevation model (DEM) interpolation and filtering methods are described in relation to the requirements of environmental models. Accurate representation of surface shape and drainage structure is a common requirement, and is facilitated by the development of locally-adaptive, process-based DEM interpolation techniques. The role of traditional contour data sources and remotely-sensed data sources is also examined. Methods for interpreting terrain include terrain parameters, as simplifications of key environmental processes, and a range of terrain features associated with secondary terrain structures. The issue of spatial scale is discussed in relation to the multi-scale requirements of environmental modelling and the identification of scaling properties of DEMs and associated terrain parameters. Multi-scale terrain feature analysis permits the incorporation of terrain structure into analyses of scale.},

abstract = {Model calibration is a critical phase in the modelling process, and the need for a well-established calibration strategy is obvious. Therefore a systematic approach for model calibration is proposed which is guided by the intended model use, and which is supported by adequate techniques, prior knowledge and expert judgement. The success of calibration will be primarily limited by the nature, amount and quality of the available data, in relation to the complexity of the model; additional limitations are the effectiveness of the applied techniques and the availability of time, man- and computer power, adequate expertise and financial resources. These limitations will often preclude a unique calibrated model. As a consequence, calibration studies should provide information on the non-uniqueness and/or uncertainty which will be left in the model (parameters) after calibration, and this uncertainty should be adequately accounted for in subsequent model applications. ?? 1995.},

Spatial distributions of topsoil carbon, ni- trogen and available phosphorus in mountain regionswere identified using supervised learningmethods, and a functional landscape analysiswas performed in order to determine the spatial soil fertility pattern for the Soyang Lakewatershed in South Korea. Specific research aimswere (1) to identify important predictors; (2) to develop digital soilmaps; (3) to assess land potentials using digital soilmaps. Soil profiles and sampleswere collected by conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling considering operational field constraints such as accessibility and no-go areas contaminated by landmines as well as budget limitations. Ter- rain parameters and different vegetation indiceswere derived for the covariates.We compared a generalized ad- ditive model (GAM) to randomforest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR). For the predictor selection, we used the recursive feature elimination (RFE). A land potential assessment for soil nutrients was conducted using trimmed k-mean cluster analysis. Results suggested that vegetation indices have powerful abilities to predict soil nutrients. Using selected predic- tors via RFE improved prediction results. RF showed the best performance. Cluster analysis identified four land potential classes: fertile, medium and low fertile with an additional class dominated by high phosphorus and low carbon and nitrogen contents due to human impact. This study provides an effective approach to map land potentials formountain ecosystem management},

abstract = {Most highly accurate predictive modelling techniques produce opaque models. When comprehensible models are required, rule extraction is sometimes used to generate a transparent model, based on the opaque. Naturally, the extracted model should be as similar as possible to the opaque. This criterion, called fidelity, is therefore a key part of the optimisation function in most rule extracting algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, all existing rule extraction algorithms targeting fidelity use 0/1 fidelity, i.e., maximise the number of identical classifications. In this paper, we suggests and evaluate a rule extraction algorithm using a more informed fidelity criterion. More specifically, the novel algorithms, which is based on genetic programming, minimises the difference in probability estimates between the extracted and the opaque models, by using the generalised Brier score as fitness function. Experimental results from 26 UCI data sets show that the suggested algorithm obtained considerably higher accuracy and significantly better AUC than both the exact same rule extraction algorithm maximizing 0/1 fidelity, and the standard tree inducer J48. Somewhat surprisingly, rule extraction using the more informed fidelity metric normally resulted in less complex models, making sure that the improved predictive performance was not achieved on the expense of comprehensibility.},

abstract = {This paper compares three models that use soil type information from point observations and a soil map to map the topsoil organic matter content for the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands. The models differ in how the information on soil type is obtained: model 1 uses soil type as depicted on the soil map for calibration and prediction; model 2 uses soil type as observed in the field for calibration and soil type as depicted on the map for prediction; and model 3 uses observed soil type for calibration and a pedometric soil map with quantified uncertainty for prediction. Calibration of the trend on observed soil type resulted in a much stronger predictive relationship between soil organic matter content and soil type than calibration on mapped soil type. Validation with an independent probability sample showed that model 3 out-performed models 1 and 2 in terms of the mean squared error. However, model 3 over-estimated the prediction error variance and so was too pessimistic about prediction accuracy. Model 2 performed the worst: it had the largest mean squared error and the prediction error variance was strongly under-estimated. Thus validation confirmed that calibration on observed soil type is only valid when the uncertainty about soil type at prediction sites is explicitly accounted for by the model. We conclude that whenever information about the uncertainty of the soil map is available and both soil property and soil type are observed at sampling sites, model 3 can be an improvement over the conventional model 1.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key element of agroecosystems functioning and has a crucial impact on global carbon storage. At the landscape scale, SOC spatial variability is strongly affected by natural and anthropogenic processes and linear anthropogenic elements (such hedges or ditches). This study aims at mapping SOC stocks distribution in the A-horizons for a depth up to 105cm, at a high spatial resolution, for an area of 10km2 in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape (North-Western France). We used a data mining tool, Cubist, to build rule-based predictive models and predict SOC content and soil bulk density (BD) from a calibration dataset at 8 standard layers (0 to 7.5cm, 7.5 to 15cm, 15 to 30cm, 30 to 45cm, 45 to 60cm, 60 to 75cm, 75 to 90cm and 90 to 105cm). For the models calibration, 70 sampling locations were selected within the whole study area using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method. Two independent validation datasets were used to assess the performance of the predictive models: (i) at landscape scale, 49 sampling locations were selected using stratified random sampling based on a 300-m square grid; (ii) at hedge vicinity, 112 sampling locations were selected along transects perpendicular to 14 purposively chosen hedges. Undisturbed samples were collected at fixed depths and analysed for BD and SOC content at each sampling location and continuous soil profiles were reconstructed using equal-area splines. Predictive environmental data consisted in attributes derived from a light detection and ranging digital elevation model (LiDAR DEM), geological variables, land use data and a predictive map of A-horizon thickness. Considering the two validation datasets (at landscape scale and hedge vicinity), root mean square errors (RMSE) of the predictions, computed for all the standard soil layers (up to a depth of 105cm), were respectively 7.74 and 5.02gkg-1 for SOC content, and 0.15 and 0.21gcm-3 for BD. Best predictions were obtained for layers between 15 and 60cm of depth. The SOC stocks were calculated over a depth of 105cm by combining the prediction of SOC content and BD. The final maps show that the carbon stocks in the soil below 30cm accounted for 33{\%} of the total SOC stocks on average. The whole method produced consistent results between the two predicted soil properties. The final SOC stocks maps provide continuous data along soil profile up to 105cm, which may be critical information for supporting carbon policy and management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that Visible Near InfraRed (Vis-NIR) hyperspectral imagery is a cost-efficient way to map soil properties at fine resolutions ({\~{}}. 5. m) over large areas. However, such mapping is only feasible for the soil surface because the effective penetration depths of optical sensors do not exceed several millimeters. This study aims to determine how Vis-NIR hyperspectral imagery can serve to map the subsurface properties at four depth intervals (15-30. cm, 30-60. cm, 60-100. cm and 30-100. cm) when used with legacy soil profiles and images of parameters derived from digital elevation model (DEM). Two types of surface-subsurface functions, namely linear models and random forests, that estimate subsurface property values from surface values and landscape covariates were first calibrated over the set of legacy measured profiles. These functions were then applied to map the soil properties using the hyperspectral-derived digital surface soil property maps and the images of landscape covariates as input. Error propagation was addressed using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the mapping uncertainties.The study was conducted in a pedologically contrasted 300km2-cultivated area located in the Cap Bon region (Northern Tunisia) and tested on three soil surface properties (clay and sand contents and cation exchange capacity). The main results were as follows: i) fairly satisfactory (cross-validation R2 between 0.55 and 0.81) surface-subsurface functions were obtained for predicting the soil properties at 15-30cm and 30-60cm, whereas predictions at 60-100cm were less accurate (R2 between 0.38 and 0.43); ii) linear models outperformed random-forest models in developing surface-subsurface functions; iii) due to the error propagations, the final predicted maps of the subsurface soil properties captured from 1/3 to 2/3 of the total variance with a significantly decreasing performance with depth; and iv) these maps brought significant improvements over the existing soil maps of the region and showed soil patterns that largely agreed with the local pedological knowledge. This paper demonstrates the added value of combining modern remote sensing techniques with old legacy soil databases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Current attempts to model ecosystem service delivery on a broad, regional scale often depend on indicator-based approaches that are generally not able to fully capture the complexity of ecosystem processes. Moreover, they do not allow quantification of uncertainty on their predictions. In this paper, we discuss a QGIS plug-in which promotes the use of Bayesian belief networks for regional modelling and mapping of ecosystem service delivery and associated uncertainties. Different types of specific Bayesian belief network output maps, delivered by the plug-in, are discussed and their decision support capacities are evaluated. This plug-in, used in combination with firmly developed Bayesian belief networks, has the potential to add value to current spatial ecosystem service accounting methods. The plug-in can also be used in other research domains dealing with spatial data and uncertainty.},

abstract = {The utility of a map of terrain classes may be measured by different components of accuracy, estimated from an error matrix. A systematic classification of the questions that such a map is required to answer is proposed. In each case the utility of the map is best measured by a different subset of the components of accuracy. It follows that no one map will be optimal from the point of view of every user (given that the perfect map cannot be made). It is shown how those components of map accuracy that are most pertinent to a particular user may be optimized.},

abstract = {Invasive nonindigenous plants are threatening the biological integrity of North American rangelands, as well as the economies that are supported by those ecosystems. Spatial information is critical to fulfilling invasive plant management strategies. Traditional invasive plant mapping has utilized ground-based hand or GPS mapping. The shortfalls of ground-based methods include the limited spatial extent covered and the associated time and cost. Mapping vegetation with remote sensing covers large spatial areas and maps can be updated at an interval determined by management needs. The objective of the study was to map leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) using 128-band hyperspectral (5-m and 3-m resolution) imagery and assess the accuracy of the resulting maps. Beiman Cutler classifications (BCC) were used to classify the imagery using the randomForest package in the R statistical program. BCC builds multiple classification trees by repeatedly taking random subsets of the observational data and using random subsets of the spectral bands to determine each split in the classification trees. The resulting classification trees vote on the correct classification. Overall accuracy was 84{\%} for the spotted knapweed classification, with class accuracies ranging from 60{\%} to 93{\%}; overall accuracy was 86{\%} for the leafy spurge classification, with class accuracies ranging from 66{\%} to 93{\%}. Our results indicate that (1) BCC can achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over single classification trees with these data and (2) it might be unnecessary to have separate accuracy assessment data when using BCC, as the algorithm provides a reliable internal estimate of accuracy. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The present study aimed to evaluate the spatial variability of soil organic matter fractions in degraded area under recovery by planting Jatropha curcas. For this purpose, a grid of 30 by 30 m was established for sampling, totalizing 55 points. At each point, soil samples were collected in the 0-0.05, 0.05-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m depths. Total organic carbon (TOC), labile carbon (LC) and fulvic acid fraction (FAF), humic acid fraction (HAF) and humin fraction (HUM) carbon were determined. The FAF at 0-0.05 and 0.10-0.20 m depths and FAH at 0.10-0.20 m depth showed coefficient of variation of 66, 74 and 77{\%}, respectively, considered high. The other variables showed mean CV ranging from 32 to 58{\%}. With the exception of the FAF and HUM (0-0.05 m), the other attributes showed spatial dependence classified as moderate or strong, varying from 39.6 and 410.9 m. Very low values of the total organic carbon and their fractions highlighted the soil degradation and indicate the need to increase carbon inputs using crops with high amount of residues.},

abstract = {Within the southern Ecuadorian Andes, landslides have an impact on landscape development. Landslide risk estimation as well as hydrological modelling requires physical soil data. Statistical models were adapted to predict the spatial distribution of soil texture from terrain parameters. For this purpose, 56 soil profiles were analysed horizon-wise by pipette and laser method. Results by pipette compared to laser method showed the expected shift to higher silt and lower clay contents. Linear regression equations were adapted. The performance of regression tree (RT) and Random Forest (RF) models was compared by hundredfold model runs on random Jackknife partitions. Digital soil maps of sand, silt and clay percentage mean and standard deviation indicate model variability and prediction uncertainty. RF models performed better than RT models. All terrain factors considered in the analysis influenced soil texture of the surface horizon, but altitude a.s.l. was assigned the highest variable importance during model construction. Shallow subsurface flow is considered responsible for increasing sand/clay ratios with increasing altitude, on steep slopes and with overland flow distance to the channel network by removing clay particles downslope. Deeper soil layers are not influenced by this process and therefore, did not show the same texture properties. However, the influence of parent material and landslides on the spatial distribution of soil texture cannot be neglected. Model performance, most probably, could be improved by a bigger dataset. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {(Myrceugenia (Myrtaceae) occurring in Itatiaia National Park, Rio de Janeiro) A morphological and taxonomic analysis of the species of Myrceugenia O. Berg (Myrtaceae) in Itatiaia National Park, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was carried out. In addition to determining the species present in the Park, the usefulness of vegetative and floral characters as diagnostic tools was evaluated. The study includes descriptions, an identification key, observations made in the field and from herbarium collections. Eight taxa were identified: Myrceugenia alpigena (DC.) Landrum var. alpigena; M. bracteosa (DC.) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel; M. campestris (DC.) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel; M. cucullata D. Legrand; M. glaucescens var. latior Burret (Landrum); M. miersiana (Gardner) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel, M. ovata var. regnelliana (O. Berg) Landrum and M. seriatoramosa (Kiaersk.) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel. Diagnostic characters found useful were the shapes of the inflorescence, the flower bud, the prophyll and the calyx-lobes, as well as the presence or absence of an intramarginal vein. Vegetative characters alone are not diagnostic to distinguish the species of Myrceugenia in the Park. Two new occurrences for the state of Rio de Janeiro were registered: M. campestris and M. cucullata.},

abstract = {In this paper we study random forests through their connection with a new framework of adaptive nearest neighbor methods. We first introduce a concept of potential nearest neighbors (k-PNN's) and show that random forests can be seen as adaptively weighted k-PNN methods. Various aspects of random forests are then studied from this perspective. We investigate the effect of terminal node sizes and splitting schemes on the performance of random forests. It has been commonly believed that random forests work best using largest trees possible. We derive a lower bound to the rate of the mean squared error of regression random forests with non-adaptive splitting schemes and show that, asymptotically, growing largest trees in such random forests is not optimal. However, it may take a very large sample size for this asymptotic result to kick in for high dimensional problems. We illustrate with simulations the effect of terminal node sizes on the prediction accuracy of random forests with other splitting schemes. In general, it is advantageous to tune the terminal node size for best performance of random forests. We further show that random forests with adaptive splitting schemes assign weights to k-PNN's in a desirable way: for the estimation at a given target point, these random forests assign voting weights to the k-PNN's of the target point according to the local importance of different input variables. We propose a new simple splitting scheme that achieves desirable adaptivity in a straightforward fashion. This simple scheme can be combined with existing algorithms. The resulting algorithm is computationally faster, and gives comparable results. Other possible aspects of random forests, such as using linear combinations in splitting, are also discussed. Simulations and real datasets are used to illustrate the results.},

abstract = {Peatlands are environmental matrices that store large amounts of organic carbon (TOC) and work as records of environmental changes. Recent record of organic carbon accumulated were assessed in two Forest National Parks, Itatiaia and Serra dos {\'{O}}rg{\~{a}}os in the Southeastern of Brazil. Based on organic and inorganic characterization, the cores from peatlands presented a predominance of organic material in an advanced stage of decomposition and those soils were classified as typical Haplosaprists Histosols. The combination of favorable topographic and climatic conditions led to rapid C accumulation across coastal mountain in the tropical peatlands studied, presenting an average accumulation rate of C, in the last century, of 194gCm−2yr−1 about 7 higher times than the rate found in boreal and subarctic peatlands, those higher values may be related to changes in the hydrological cycle occurred since 1950s.},

Em 1996, os mesmos dados foram coletados para avaliar a recupera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da trilha no per{\'{i}}odo de um ano. Podem ser considerados bons indicadores, a {\'{a}}rea da se{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o transversal da trilha, o n{\'{u}}mero de caminhos n{\~{a}}o oficiais e a {\'{a}}rea de solo exposto. O grau de declividade e o tipo de solo foram os principais fatores facilitadores da degrada{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da trilha estudada. A compacta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do solo, ao contr{\'{a}}rio do resultado de outros trabalhos, n{\~{a}}o mostrou rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o efetiva com as {\'{a}}reas mais impactadas. Constatou-se em teste de germina{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do banco de sementes, em amostras coletadas no centro da trilha, que o maior n{\'{u}}mero de plantas germinadas estava relacionado a um solo com alto teores mais elevados de mat{\'{e}}ria org{\^{a}}nica e de nutrientes. Al{\'{e}}m dos fatores naturais, dados referentes ao manejo da {\'{a}}rea foram obtidos na Administra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do parque e atrav{\'{e}}s de entrevistas com funcion{\'{a}}rios. A an{\'{a}}lise dos Relat{\'{o}}rios referentes ao per{\'{i}}odo de 1940 a 1984, demonstrou que os fatores institucionais, ligados {\`{a}} administra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do parque, contribu{\'{i}}ram fortemente para a degrada{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de parte do ecossistema estudado. Conclui-se que o processo de regenera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da vegeta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o nos locais mais impactados ser{\'{a}} acelerado com a utiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de t{\'{e}}cnicas simples, como, por exemplo, escarifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e aduba{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do solo e dissipa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do volume da enxurrada canalizada no interior da trilha, atrav{\'{e}}s da constru{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de pequenos canais e terra{\c{c}}os ao longo de sua extens{\~{a}}o.

abstract = {The problem of variable selection within the class of generalized additive models, when there are many covariates to choose from but the number of predictors is still somewhat smaller than the number of observations, is considered. Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Land component boundaries often coincide with transitions in environmental land properties such as soil, climate and biology. Image segmentation is an effective method for delineating terrain morphological units from digital elevation models (DEMs). This paper compares the land components derived from five DEMs. The second version of the 30-m advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global DEM (ASTER GDEM2), the 90-m shuttle radar topography mission DEM (SRTM DEM), two versions of the 5-m Stellenbosch University DEMs (SUDEM L1 and L2) and a 5-m DEM (GEOEYE DEM) derived from GeoEye stereo-images were considered. The SRTM DEM and the ASTER GDEM2 were upsampled to 5-m resolution for comparison purposes. Land components were delineated using the slope gradient and aspect derivatives of each DEM. The resulting land components were visually inspected and quantitatively analyzed using the slope gradient standard deviation (SGSD) measure and the mean slope gradient local variance (MSGLV) ratio. The results show that the GEOEYE DEM and SUDEM L2 yielded land components with relatively low SGSD values and that their boundaries often coincide with morphological discontinuities. The GEOEYE DEM produced land components with the highest MSGLV ratio, followed by SUDEM L2, ASTER GDEM2, SRTM DEM and SUDEM L1. Although the land components derived from SRTM DEM and SUDEM L1 were relatively homogeneous internally, their boundaries did not always trace morphological discontinuities. The ASTER GDEM2 failed to incorporate many of the morphological discontinuities in the study area. It is concluded that, although the SRTM DEM is more suitable than the ASTER GDEM2 for generating land components, higher-resolution DEMs such as the GEOEYE DEM and SUDEM L2 are required for delineating meaningful land components. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We review various recent approaches to making digital soil maps based on geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, note some commonalities and propose a generic framework for the future. We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their ?environment?. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the ?environment?. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny?s five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution q and block size b. (ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q. (iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers. (iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites. (v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data. (vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham?s razor) with autocorrelated errors. (vii) Predict digital map. (viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing. (ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v). Finally, possible applications, problems and improvements are discussed.},

abstract = {This report evidences factors controlling soil organic carbon at the national scale by modelling data of 2,158 soil samples from France. The global soil carbon amount, of about 1,500 Gt C, is approximately twice the amount of atmosphere C. Therefore, soil has major impact on atmospheric CO2, and, in turn, climate change. Soil organic carbon further controls many soil properties such as fertility, water retention and aggregate stability. Nonetheless, precise mechanisms ruling interactions between soil organic carbon and environmental factors are not well known at the large scale. Indeed, most soil investigations have been conducted at the plot scale using a limited number of factors. Therefore, a national soil survey of 2,158 soil samples from France was carried out to measure soil properties such as texture, organic carbon, nitrogen and heavy metal content. Here, we studied factors controlling soil organic carbon at the national scale using a model based on stepwise linear regression. Factors analysed were land use, soil texture, rock fragment content, climate and land management. We used several criteria for model selection, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the corrected AIC rule and the Bayesian information criterion. Results show that organic carbon concentrations in fine earth increase with increasing rock fragment content, depending on land use and texture. Spreading farmyard manure and slurry induces higher carbon concentrations mostly in wet and stony grasslands. Nonetheless, a negative correlation has been found between carbon and direct C input from animal excrements on grasslands. Our findings will therefore help to define better land management practices to sequester soil carbon.},

abstract = {This paper describes the basis functioning and implementation of a computer-aided Bayesian Network (BN) method that is able to incorporate experts' knowledge for the benefit of remote sensing applications and other raster data analyses: Bayesian Network for Raster Data (BayNeRD). Using a case study of soybean mapping in Mato Grosso State, Brazil, BayNeRD was tested to evaluate its capability to support the understanding of a complex phenomenon through plausible reasoning based on data observation. Observations made upon Crop Enhanced Index (CEI) values for the current and previous crop years, soil type, terrain slope, and distance to the nearest road and water body were used to calculate the probability of soybean presence for the entire Mato Grosso State, showing strong adherence to the official data. CEI values were the most influencial variables in the calculated probability of soybean presence, stating the potential of remote sensing as a source of data. Moreover, the overall accuracy of over 91{\%} confirmed the high accuracy of the thematic map derived from the calculated probability values. BayNeRD allows the expert to model the relationship among several observed variables, outputs variable importance information, handles incomplete and disparate forms of data, and offers a basis for plausible reasoning from observations. The BayNeRD algorithm has been implemented in R software and can be found on the internet.},

organic carbon seems to be an important tool to decrease costs and
subjectivity of sampling schemes. The main objective of this work
was to test this method in a no sampled area, aiming to evaluate
its efficiency in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) procedures. The results
show that this method was able to significantly increase the reliability
in the spatial distribution of the sampled points in Parque Estadual
da Mata Seca (PEMS). The study area is located in the North of Minas
Gerais State, Brazil, in Tropical Dry Forest (TDF) ecosystems mainly.
In this study, the cLHS algorithm developed by Minasny {\&} McBratney
(2006) was used, in addition to some ancillary data as Land Use/Land
Cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order
to select 60 soil sampling location to the study of soil organic
carbon and others soil properties. The cLHS will be further analyzed
in its performance to select representative points to be sampled
and how this method could be helpful for DSM.},

abstract = {Prediction of soil attributes (properties and classes) in digital soil mapping (DSM) is based on the correlation between primary soil attributes and secondary environmental attributes. These secondary attributes can be obtained relatively cheaply over large areas. In the presence of these environmental covariates, a strategic sampling design needs to ensure the coverage of the full range of environmental variables. This could enhance the full representation of the expected soil properties or soil classes. This chapter presents the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) as a sampling strategy on existing data layers. LHS is a stratified-random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. This method is illustrated with examples from DSM of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, equal spatial strata and principal component (PC). Results showed that the LHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.},

Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a stratified random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. For conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) the problem is: given N sites with ancillary variables (X), select x a sub-sample of size n(n ??? N) in order that x forms a Latin hypercube, or the multivariate distribution of X is maximally stratified. This paper presents the cLHS method with a search algorithm based on heuristic rules combined with an annealing schedule. The method is illustrated with a simple 3-D example and an application in digital soil mapping of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, and equal spatial strata.

abstract = {The present paper evaluates five methods for building Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) from partial expert information: functional interpolation, the Elicitation BBN, the Cain calculator, Fenton et al. and R{\o}ed et al. methods. The evaluation considers application to a specific field of risk analysis, Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). The five methods are particularly suited for HRA models calculating the human error probability as a function of influencing factor assessments. The performance of the methods is evaluated on two simple examples, designed to test aspects relevant for HRA (but not exclusively): the representation of strong factor influences and interactions, the representation of uncertainty on the BBN relationships, and the method requirements as the BBN size increases. The evaluation underscores modelling limitations related to the treatment of multi-factor interdependencies and of different degrees of uncertainty in the factor relationships. The functional interpolation method is the least susceptible to these limitations; however, its elicitation requirements grow exponentially with the model size. Besides expert judgment, HRA applications of BBNs include the use of empirical data, combination of data and judgment, information from existing HRA methods: the building of the CPTs in these applications is outside the scope of the evaluation.},

abstract = {Accurate determination of near surface soil electrical properties is important for agricultural and environmental management. In this respect, low frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI) has been widely used to measure soil apparent electrical conductivity. However, the potential to model soil subsurface layering has not been fully realized using EMI data. In this paper, we applied a probabilistic optimization approach, namely DREAM (ZS), on Geonics EM38 data to explore the robustness of this approach for soil subsurface conductivity mapping. The EM38 data was measured from the Ardakan region in the province of Yazd located in central Iran. Several soil samples were taken and were further analyzed in a laboratory to derive soil textural and physical parameters. The probabilistic inversion was performed in a joint multi-configuration framework considering a five layered model. The estimated values are mainly in agreement with the clay map (as the most influential factor); nevertheless, soil salinity data and inversely estimated conductivity values are poorly correlated for deeper layers due to the aridic condition and high clay content in the study area. DREAM (ZS) optimization approach appears to be promising for accurate retrieval of soil conductivity depth profile from EM38 data.},

abstract = {The principle of using induction rules based on spatial environmental data to model a soil map has previously been demonstrated. Whilst the general pattern of classes of large spatial extent and those with close association with geology were delineated, small classes and the detailed spatial pattern of the map were less well rendered. Here we examine several strategies to improve the quality of the soil map models generated by rule induction. Terrain attributes that are better-suited to landscape description at a resolution of 250 m are introduced as predictors of soil type. A map sampling strategy is developed. Classification error is reduced by using boosting rather than cross-validation to improve the model. Further, the benefit of incorporating the local spatial context for each environmental variable into the rule induction is examined. The best model was achieved by sampling in proportion to the spatial extent of the mapped classes, boosting the decision trees, and using spatial contextual information extracted from the environmental variables.},

abstract = {This article reviews the use of optical and microwave remote sensing data for soil and terrain mapping with emphasis on applications at regional and coarser scales. Remote sensing is expected to offer possibilities for improving incomplete spatial and thematic coverage of current regional and global soil databases. Traditionally, remotely sensed imagery have been used to support segmentation of the landscape into rather homogeneous soil-landscape units for which soil composition can be established by sampling. Soil properties have also been inferred from optical and microwave data using physically-based and empirical methods. Used as a secondary data source, remotely sensed imagery may support spatial interpolation of sparsely sampled soil property data. Soil properties that have been measured using remote or proximal sensing approaches include mineralogy, texture, soil iron, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil salinity and carbonate content. In sparsely vegetated areas, successful use of space borne, airborne, and in situ measurements using optical, passive and active microwave instruments has been reported. On the other hand, in densely vegetated areas, soil data acquisition typically relied on indirect retrievals using soil indicators, such as plant functional groups, productivity changes, and Ellenberg indicator values. Several forms of kriging, classification and regression tree analyses have been used jointly with remotely sensed data to predict soil properties at unvisited locations aiming at obtaining continuous area coverage. We expect that remotely sensed data from existing platforms and planned missions can provide an important data source supporting digital soil mapping. Yet, most studies so far have been performed on a local scale and only few on regional or smaller map scale. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal properties of existing data sources. For example, space borne spectroscopy has been of limited use in retrieving soil data when compared to laboratory or field spectroscopy. To date, there is no coherent methodology established, where approaches of spatial segmentation, measurements of soil properties and interpolation using remotely sensed data are integrated in a holistic fashion to achieve complete area coverage. Such approaches will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for digital soil mapping. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This work presents the first high-resolution map of soil organic carbon (SOC) in mainland France, including soils below 30. cm. The research was performed within the framework of GlobalSoilMap (GSM). SOC predictions for different depth layers (0-5. cm, 5-15. cm, 15-30. cm, 30-60. cm, 60-100. cm and {\textgreater}. 100. cm) were made at 90 and 500. m resolution for mainland France, along with their upper and lower confidence intervals. The maps were developed using data mining and an elaborate cross-validation scheme. The 90. m maps were compared to 500. m resolution GlobalSoilMap maps and the SoilGrids1km (SG1km) product. The latter is a global model for predicting soil properties for the same depth layers, at 1. km resolution.At 90 and 500. m resolution, the predicted SOC content was unbiased and showed good agreement with the measured SOC, despite the poor model diagnostics and decrease of performance with depth. It was found that the subsoil ({\textgreater}. 30. cm) carbon pool for France contributes 49{\%} to the total soil carbon stock. The use of coarser resolution prediction grids resulted in smoother spatial patterns and wider confidence intervals; however, it did not bias the estimated carbon stocks. Applying GlobalSoilMap specifications to France, using a large soil dataset and all the exhaustive spatially available data outperformed SG1km predictions. The overall spatial patterns of the SG1km SOC content were found to be very similar to the GlobalSoilMap maps. However, the SG1km overestimated the SOC content and carbon stocks ({\textgreater}. 75{\%} for the total carbon stock, and 100{\%} for the stocks below 30. cm) and showed a similar spatial distribution over the different soil depth layers. The main reason for the overestimation was that the local data used in SG1km was rather small (56 samples) and not representative in terms of SOC content or represented soil types; the profiles had far higher SOC content and this may have propagated in the modelled vertical profile and the kriging part of the residuals. Improvements for SG1km may entail the use of a representative national subsample from large national soil databases. Furthermore, a bottom-up approach such as GlobalSoilMap may be more favourable when considering prediction accuracies, data privacy policies and local acceptance of generated products.},

abstract = {In this work we aimed at developing a conceptual framework in which we improve our understanding of the controlling factors for soil organic carbon (SOC) over vast areas at different depths. We postulated that variability in SOC levels may be better explained by modeling SOC within soil-landscape systems (SLSs). The study was performed in mainland France, and explanatory SOC models were developed for the sampled topsoil (0-30 cm) and subsoil ({\textgreater}30 cm), using both directed and undirected data-mining techniques. With this study we demonstrated that there is a shift in controlling factors both in space and depth which were mainly related to (1) typical SLS characteristics and (2) human-induced changes to SLSs. The controlling factors in relation to depth alter from predominantly biotic to more abiotic with increasing depth. Especially, water availability, soil texture, and physical protection control deeper stored SOC. In SLSs with similar SOC levels, different combinations of physical protection, the input of organic matter, and climatic conditions largely determined the SOC level. The SLS approach provided the means to partition the data into data sets that were having homogenous conditions with respect to this combination of controlling factors. This information may provide important information on the carbon storage and sequestration potential of a soil.},

abstract = {The saturation problem associated with the use of NDVI for biomass estimation in high canopy density vegetation is a well known phenomenon. Recent field spectroscopy experiments have shown that narrow band vegetation indices computed from the red edge and the NIR shoulder can improve the estimation of biomass in such situations. However, the wide scale unavailability of high spectral resolution satellite sensors with red edge bands has not seen the up-scaling of these techniques to spaceborne remote sensing of high density biomass. This paper explored the possibility of estimate biomass in a densely vegetated wetland area using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from WorldView-2 imagery, which contains a red edge band centred at 725 nm. NDVI was calculated from all possible two band combinations of WorldView-2. Subsequently, we utilized the random forest regression algorithm as variable selection and a regression method for predicting wetland biomass. The performance of random forest regression in predicting biomass was then compared against the widely used stepwise multiple linear regression. Predicting biomass on an independent test data set using the random forest algorithm and 3 NDVIs computed from the red edge and NIR bands yielded a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.441 kg/m2 (12.9{\%} of observed mean biomass) as compared to the stepwise multiple linear regression that produced an RMSEP of 0.5465 kg/m2 (15.9{\%} of observed mean biomass). The results demonstrate the utility of WorldView-2 imagery and random forest regression in estimating and ultimately mapping vegetation biomass at high density-a previously challenging task with broad band satellite sensors. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Disaggregation of conventional soil surveys has been identified as a potential source for much of the next generation of model-ready digital soil spatial data. This process aims to apportion vector soil surveys into raster (gridded) representations of the component soils that are often aggregated together in map unit designs. Most soil surveys are published with some description of the soil-landscape relationships that distinguish component soils within map units. We used these descriptions found in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of Webster and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, USA, to build a set of representative training areas for all soil components by using 1-arc second digital elevation data and derived geomorphic indices. These training areas were then used in classification tree ensembles with a more extensive environmental database to transform the original SSURGO map into a gridded soil series map. We created underlying prediction frequency surfaces from the models that can be used for creating continuous representations of soil class and property distributions. Disaggregation models matched training sets in 71{\%}-74{\%} of pixels and matched components in original SSURGO map units in 56{\%}-65{\%} of the study area. We evaluated both the original SSURGO data and our models using 87 independent pedons not used in model building. Validation pedons matched components in SSURGO map units at 39{\%} of sites, but in map units that only included one named component (as opposed to multiple soils that could be matched to validation pedons) only 27{\%} of the sites matched. Disaggregation predictions matched validation pedon classes 22-24{\%} of the time using nearest neighbor spatial matches, and these rates increased to 39-44{\%} for correct predictions within a 60-meter radius of the pedon. To characterize uncertainty, we compared relative ensemble prediction frequency (probability) of final hardened model classes at validation sites. Sites with correct predictions had generally higher prediction frequencies; which lead us to use them to create an uncertainty model. Uncertainty was calculated by determining the rate of correct predictions at validation sites within different intervals of prediction frequencies using nearest neighbor validation results. We were able to discern four uncertainty classes with values of 7{\%}, 18{\%}, 20{\%} and 43{\%}, which we called "ground truth probabilities". We present the methods to create these models as a specific example of how disaggregation techniques may be used to aid in updating national soil survey inventories. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Rainfall erosivity is the capability of rainfall to cause soil loss from hillslopes by water. Modern definitions of rainfall erosivity began with the development of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), where rainfall characteristics were statistically related to soil loss from thousands of plot-years of natural rainfall and runoff data. USLE erosivity combines the energy of the rainfall and the maximum continuous 30-min intensity in the event. Energy of rainfall is estimated as a function of the storm intensity through the rainfall event. The USLE erosivity has been used effectively for conservation planning purposes for more than 5 decades. When the USLE was replaced by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), a new energy-intensity equation was adopted. The new equation was not extensively tested prior to adoption, leads to significant under-predictions of erosivity, and was later replaced in RUSLE2. The RUSLE energy-intensity equation is no longer recommended by the RUSLE and RUSLE2 development teams. RUSLE2 also introduced the concept of erosivity density, which resulted in significant improvements in the calculations and mapping of rainfall erosivity. Calculations of erosivity as a whole are entirely based on rainfall intensities, and erosivity is an empirically-based index. The science indicates that the direct role of kinetic energy of rainfall as the driver of hillslope erosion in all cases is not warranted by the overall evidence, because many times the kinetic energy of raindrops is not the driving force behind rill erosion. The USLE erosivity empirically explains much of the variance in the soil loss from natural rainfall erosion plots.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are required to quantify carbon sources and sinks caused by land use change at national scale. This study presents a novel robust kriging method to precisely estimate regional and national mean SOC stocks, along with truthful standard errors. We used this new approach to estimate mean forest SOC stock for Switzerland and for its five main ecoregions. Using data of 1033 forest soil profiles, we modelled stocks of two compartments (0-30, 0-100 cm depth) of mineral soils. Log-normal regression models that accounted for correlation between SOC stocks and environmental covariates and residual (spatial) auto-correlation were fitted by a newly developed robust restricted maximum likelihood method, which is insensitive to outliers in the data. Precipitation, near-infrared reflectance, topographic and aggregated information of a soil and a geotechnical map were retained in the models. Both models showed weak but significant residual autocorrelation. The predictive power of the fitted models, evaluated by comparing predictions with independent data of 175 soil profiles, was moderate (robust R-2 = 0.34 for SOC stock in 0-30 cm and R-2 = 0.40 in 0-100 cm). Prediction standard errors (SE), validated by comparing point prediction intervals with data, proved to be conservative. Using the fitted models, we mapped forest SOC stock by robust external-drift point kriging at high resolution across Switzerland. Predicted mean stocks in 0-30 and 0100 cm depth were equal to 7.99 kg m(-2) (SE 0.15 kg m(-2)) and 12.58 kg m(-2) (SE 0.24 kg m(-2)), respectively. Hence, topsoils store about 64{\%} of SOC stocks down to 100 cm depth. Previous studies underestimated SOC stocks of topsoil slightly and those of subsoils strongly. The comparison further revealed that our estimates have substantially smaller SE than previous estimates.},

S'ajoute {\`{a}} cela les co{\^{u}}ts tr{\`{e}}s {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}}s de la r{\'{e}}colte des donn{\'{e}}es qui augmentent d'une fa{\c{c}}on exponen-tielle {\`{a}} mesure que l'{\'{e}}chelle diminue. Dans cet article, nous discutons de l'importance de l'{\'{e}}chel-le en ce qui concerne l'interpr{\'{e}}tation des donn{\'{e}}es du sol. Pour cela, nous avons compar{\'{e}} 3 cartes de sol {\`{a}} des {\'{e}}chelles diff{\'{e}}rentes (1:200000, 1:25000, 1:5000) pour la m{\^{e}}me r{\'{e}}gion (bassin versant de Lippenr{\"{u}}tibach et Grosse Aa, canton de Lucerne). Afin de quantifier cette comparai-son, nous avons calcul{\'{e}} la plage d'erreurs poten-tielles li{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} la d{\'{e}}limitation des polygones indi-viduels et calcul{\'{e}} le pourcentage de la surface re-pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}e par les polygones complexes (avec des informations non-univoques et des donn{\'{e}}es spatiales non-d{\'{e}}finies). Une surface importante de la r{\'{e}}gion cartographi{\'{e}}e est attribu{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} des er-reurs potentielles d{\'{e}}limitant les polygones. A l'{\'{e}}chelle de 1:200000, cela repr{\'{e}}sente plus de 42{\%} et {\`{a}} 1:25000 plus de 22{\%} de la surface tota-le. A l'{\'{e}}chelle 1:5000, cette proportion est sup{\'{e}}-rieure {\`{a}} 15{\%} de la surface totale. La carte {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}chelle de 1:200000 consiste uniquement (100{\%}) en polygones complexes tandis que, {\`{a}} une {\'{e}}chelle de 1:5000, cette part est r{\'{e}}duite {\`{a}} 15{\%}. Par cons{\'{e}}quent, l'{\'{e}}chelle de la carte est une donn{\'{e}}e d{\'{e}}cisive {\`{a}} consid{\'{e}}rer vis-{\`{a}}-vis du contenu informatif et de l'utilisation pratique des cartes de sol. M{\^{e}}me les cartes de sol avec une haute r{\'{e}}solution spatiale contiennent toujours des incertitudes substantielles. Zusammenfassung: Die Relevanz des Massstabs bei Bodenkarten Der Massstab hat einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf das, was wir aus Bodenkarten herauslesen k{\"{o}}nnen. Bei Bodenkarten kommt speziell die Problematik hinzu, dass die Kosten f{\"{u}}r die Daten-erhebung hoch sind und exponentiell mit der Ver-ringerung der Massstabszahl ansteigen. In die-sem Aufsatz diskutieren wir die Bedeutung des Massstabs f{\"{u}}r die Anwendung und Interpretation von Bodendaten. Dazu wurden 3 Bodenkarten mit unterschiedlichem Massstab (1:200000, 1:25000 und 1:5000) {\"{u}}ber dasselbe Gebiet (Ein-zugsgebiet Lippenr{\"{u}}tibach und Grosse Aa, Kt. Luzern) miteinander verglichen. Um die Be-deutung des Massstabs grob zu quantifizieren, wurden die m{\"{o}}glichen Fehlerbereiche bei der Grenzziehung zwischen einzelnen Polygonen und der Anteil an komplexen Polygonen (mit nicht-eindeutigen fachlichen und r{\"{a}}umlichen Informationszuweisungen) berechnet. Ein beacht-licher Teil der gesamten kartierten Fl{\"{a}}che entf{\"{a}}llt in den Fehlerbereich der Grenzziehung von Poly-gonen. Bei einem Massstab von 1:200000 sind dies mindestens 42 {\%} und bei 1:25000 immer noch ≥ 22 {\%} der gesamten Fl{\"{a}}che. Auch ein Kar-tierungsmassstab von 1:5000 enth{\"{a}}lt immer noch einen Fehlerbereich von mindestens 15 {\%}. Die kleinmassst{\"{a}}bige Karte (1:200000) besteht nur aus komplexen Polygonen, w{\"{a}}hrenddem bei 1:5000 dieser Anteil auf etwa 15{\%} der Gesamt-fl{\"{a}}che reduziert wird. Der Massstab entscheidet vollumf{\"{a}}nglich {\"{u}}ber den Informationsgehalt und den praktischen Nutzen von Bodenkarten. Selbst Karten mit einer kleinen Massstabszahl enthalten immer noch substantielle Unsicherheiten.},

abstract = {The objective of the work presented in this paper was to investigate how rasters of the probabilities of occurrence of soil classes may be used to create digital soil property maps and maps of their associated uncertainties. The approach we present is formalised in an algorithm we developed called “Digital Soil Property Mapping Using Soil Class Probability Rasters” (PROPR). The soil class probability rasters were derived previously from a spatial disaggregation of the 1:250,000-scale Dalrymple Shire legacy soil polygon map from central Queensland, Australia. We created digital soil property maps of soil pH1:5 H2O and their uncertainties (as indicated by estimates of the limits of the 90{\%} prediction interval) at six depth increments down the soil profile (0–5cm, 5–15cm, 15–30cm, 30–60cm, 60–100cm, 100–200cm). The calculation of the weighted mean soil pH value for each depth increment at each grid cell was based on reference pH values for each soil class and used the probabilities of occurrence at each grid cell as weights. The calculation of the prediction interval limits for each depth increment involved sampling from the triangular distribution of the soil pH of each soil class using the soil class probabilities at each grid cell as weights in order to identify the number of samples to draw from each distribution. The 90{\%} prediction interval limits were then estimated as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of samples drawn from the soil classes' triangular distributions. The maps of soil pH displayed strong spatial patterns. Soil pH generally increased with depth. Uncertainty generally increased with depth. Validation on 300 randomly-selected soil profiles returned a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.193 at the surface increasing to 0.266 at depth. RMSE increased with depth from about 0.75pH units at the surface to 1.15 at depth. Soil class probability rasters are useful for generating digital soil property maps and maps of the associated uncertainties. Validation left room for improvement but the quality of the results is probably strongly affected by the quality of the spatial disaggregation that produced the soil class probability rasters. The PROPR approach may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. Generation of the soil class probability rasters to use in PROPR is a predictive exercise in itself and so is also subject to uncertainty. The probability rasters likely can be derived by several methods including logistic regression and data mining; the probability rasters we used were derived via spatial disaggregation of a legacy soil polygon map. PROPR may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. The soil class probability rasters need to be produced separately. Information on the within-soil-class variability of the target soil property at each depth increment must be known in order to establish the triangular distributions for the uncertainty estimation. PROPR may reduce reliance on having sufficient soil profile observations in areas where such data is limiting. We used available profile observations to estimate the within-soil-class variability in order to establish triangular distributions for the soil classes in our study area, but the information required to do so could also be derived from legacy reports or expert knowledge.},

abstract = {This paper presents the impact of ecotourism1 on livelihood and natural resource management in the periphery of Amboseli Biosphere Reserve in Kenya. Ecotourism initiatives that have been introduced by Porini Ecotourism, a private investor, are benefiting Eselenkei Group Ranch in terms of income, improved infrastructure, employment opportunities and exposure. Over US{\$}5000 is received annually as land rent, gate fee and bed charges. Twenty-six Maasai men are employed for the upkeep of project facilities. The community's capacity to facilitate resource-related conflicts has improved following support from development institutions. An expanding livelihood base is reducing local vulnerability to disaster and people–wildlife conflicts. The numbers of resident wildlife species in the conservation area have increased due to regeneration of woody species and reduced frequency of livestock. Despite the achievements, ecotourism is threatened by cultivation. The latter is jeopardizing conservation efforts, as the area frequented by wildlife is being lost and people–wildlife conflicts intensified. Another dilemma is that the Eselenkei community is not effectively participating in ecotourism a situation that is associated with inadequate management and negotiation skills in the group ranch committee. The latter requires leadership and microenterprise management skills if earnings from ecotourism are to be effectively invested in alternative sources of livelihood, to reduce current and potential conflicts. There is also need to build the community's capacity for the promotion of activities that compliment ecotourism. Frequent breakdown of community boreholes lead to dependence on the conservation area for water during prolonged drought, intensifying conflicts between livestock and wildlife},

abstract = {abstract Recreational uses of unsurfaced trails inevitably result in their degradation, with the type and extent of resource impact influenced by factors such as soil texture, topography, climate, trail design and main- tenance, and type and amount of use. Of particular concern, the loss of soil through erosion is generally considered a significant and irreversible form of trail impact. This research investigated the influence of several use-related, environmental, and managerial factors on soil loss on recreational trails and roads at Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area, a unit of the U.S. National Park Service. Regression modeling revealed that trail position, trail slope alignment angle, grade, water drainage, and type of use are significant determinants of soil loss. The introduction of individual and groups of variables into a series of regression models provides improved understanding and insights regarding the relative influence of these variables, informing the selection of more effective trail management actions. Study results suggest that trail erosion can be minimized by avoiding ‘‘fall-line'' alignments, steep grades, and valley-bottom alignments near streams, installing and maintaining adequate densities of tread drainage features, applying gravel to harden treads, and reducing horse and all-terrain vehicle use or restricting them to more resistant routes. This research also sought to develop a more efficient Variable Cross-Sectional Area method for assessing soil loss on trails. This method permitted incorporation of CSA measures in a representative sampling scheme applied to a large (24{\%}) sample of the park's 526 km trail system. The variety of soil loss measures derived from the Variable CSA method, including extrapolated trail-wide soil loss estimates, permit an objective quantification of soil erosion on recreational trails and roads. Such data support relational analyses to increase understanding of trail degradation, and long-term monitoring of the natural and recreational integrity of the trail system infrastructure},

However, the increased flow of people in these areas may endanger the ecological integrity of these environments preserved since the intensification of tourist crossing the tracks may enhance the possibility of soil compaction (soil degradation). This study aims to evaluate the effect of the movement of people in some soil physical properties of the State Park trails Cerrado (PR) to guide future actions in planning the use and occupation of the area that contribute to the preservation of the ecosystem. To evaluate the physical soil were collected at random points, 5 soil samples off track (FTr) and track (Tr) with preserved structure in the depth of 0-20 cm. With these samples, we determined the bulk density, total porosity, macro and micro, organic matter and aggregate stability. The trails of the state park Cerrado (PR) receiving more than 50 visitors over the month, showed no degradation as the organic matter content and soil aggregation in relation to the area of native soil.},

abstract = {Fire occurrence, which results from the presence of an ignition source and the conditions for a fire to spread, is an essential component of fire risk assessment. In this paper, we present and compare the results of the application of two different methods to identify the main structural factors that explain the likelihood of fire occurrence at European scale.Data on the number of fires for the countries of the European Mediterranean region during the main fire season (June-September) were obtained from the European Fire Database of the European Forest Fire Information System. Fire density (number of fires/km 2) was estimated based on interpolation techniques and was used as the dependent variable in the model. As predictors, different physical, socio-economic and demographic variables were selected based on their potential influence in fire occurrence and on their availability at the European level. Two different methods were applied for the analysis: traditional Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest, the latter being a non-parametric alternative based on an ensemble of classification and regression trees. The predictive ability of the two models, the variables selected by each method and their level of importance were compared and the potential implications to forest management and fire prevention were discussed.The Random Forest model showed a higher predictive ability than Multiple Linear Regression. Furthermore, the analysis of the residuals also indicated a better performance of the Random Forest model, showing that this method has potentiality to be applied in the assessment of fire-related phenomena at a broad scale. Some of the variables selected are common to both models; precipitation and soil moisture seem to influence fire occurrence to a large extent. Unemployment rate, livestock density and density of local roads were also found significant by both methods. Maps of the likelihood of fire occurrence were obtained from each method at 10. km resolution, based on the selected variables. Both models show that the spatial distribution of fire occurrence likelihood is highly variable in this region: highest fire likelihood is prevalent in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula and southern Italy, whereas it is low in northern France, northeast Italy and north of Greece. In the most fire-prone areas, preventive measures could be implemented, associated to the factors identified by both models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Landscape heterogeneity analysis is fundamental in ecotourism planning since it estimates an optimal relationship between conservation and tourist alternatives. The landscape methodology approach enables to describe not only the scenic beauty, but also the degrees of stability in ecological systems. Landscape research for ecotourism integrates the different natural components (relief, climatic conditions, soil, vegetation cover etc.) and evaluates their interrelationships with the characteristics of the tourist destination. The geomorphology is often regarded as one of the most important factors controlling the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape in areas with high topographic variation. In this case, landform parameters indicate temperature and moisture distribution, exposure towards wind, vegetation, habitats etc. The study area is the Serra dos {\'{O}}rg{\~{a}}os National Park, one of Brazil's most visited national parks, with a vast number of options for ecotourism visitors, such as ecological diversity, historical significance and recreational opportunities. The present paper aims to define the landscape units of Serra dos {\'{O}}rg{\~{a}}os National Park from the remote sensing and terrain attributes. Moreover the paper analyzes the distribution of tourist attraction in relation to the landscape units. Thus, the analysis procedure considers the types of landscapes, spatial structures and limitations. The methodology can be divided in the following stages: (a) digital processing of the terrain attributes images from digital elevation model; (b) remote sensing image interpretation, and (c) delimitation and analysis of the ecotourism attraction. The data integration enabled to identify units in two different hierarchical scale levels. In the geosystem scale, seven classes had been identified presenting different dynamics and environmental vulnerabilities. The method of landscape analysis for ecotourism provided a holistic perspective as well as recreational potential evaluation},

abstract = {The measurement of soil erodibility (K) in the field is tedious, time-consuming and expensive; therefore, its prediction through pedotransfer functions (PTFs) could be far less costly and time-consuming. The aim of this study was to develop new PTFs to estimate the K factor using multiple linear regression, Mamdani fuzzy inference systems, and artificial neural networks. For this purpose, K was measured in 40 erosion plots with natural rainfall. Various soil properties including the soil particle size distribution, calcium carbonate equivalent, organic matter, permeability, and wet-aggregate stability were measured. The results showed that the mean measured K was 0.014 t h MJ− 1 mm− 1 and 2.08 times less than the estimated mean K (0.030 t h MJ− 1 mm− 1) using the USLE model. Permeability, wet-aggregate stability, very fine sand, and calcium carbonate were selected as independent variables by forward stepwise regression in order to assess the ability of multiple linear regression, Mamdani fuzzy inference systems and artificial neural networks to predict K. The calcium carbonate equivalent, which is not accounted for in the USLE model, had a significant impact on K in multiple linear regression due to its strong influence on the stability of aggregates and soil permeability. Statistical indices in validation and calibration datasets determined that the artificial neural networks method with the highest R2, lowest RMSE, and lowest ME was the best model for estimating the K factor. A strong correlation (R2 = 0.81, n = 40, p {\textless} 0.05) between the estimated K from multiple linear regression and measured K indicates that the use of calcium carbonate equivalent as a predictor variable gives a better estimation of K in areas with calcareous soils.},

abstract = {Five rainforest areas situated inthe ItatiaiaMountainRange,states ofMinas GeraisandRio de Janeiro,SEBrazil, were surveyed in order to produce a checklist of tree species of the regional forests. This checklist resulted from floristic surveys carried out in the five forest fragments, and phytosociological surveys in three of them. An additional checklist produced for a forest area situatedon the Itatiaia southern slopes, state of Rio de Janeiro, was extracted fromthe literature to help assessing the variations in floristic composition. The tree flora sampled in the five studied areas was composed of 450 species, 191 genera and 69 families, many of which are known as characteristic ofmontane forests (situated above 1,000m of altitude). The tree flora of the Itatiaia Range forests may be considered as one of the richest in species among areas of montane rain forest in SE Brazil. A cluster analysis identified patterns of floristic similarityamongthe six forest areasof the ItatiaiaRangewhichwere related to the occurrence of periodic floods in an area of alluvial rain forest, to differences in slope aspect (oceanic or continental) among the five areas of montane rain forest, and to the early sucessional stage of one of these. The highest similarity was obtained between the areas of mature montane rain forest of the continental slope, in Aiuruoca and Bocaina de Minas, although the geographical distance between them was much greater than the distances between the latter and the areas of alluvial forest and early sucessional forest.},

abstract = {An important issue in ecohydrological research is distribution modelling, aiming at the prediction of species or vegetation type occurrence on the basis of empirical relations with hydrological or hydrogeochemical habitat conditions. In this study, two statistical techniques are evaluated: (i) the widely used multiple logistic regression technique in the generalized linear modelling framework, and (ii) a recently developed machine learning technique called 'random forests'. The latter is an ensemble learning technique that generates many classification trees and aggregates the individual results. The two different techniques are used to develop distribution models to predict the vegetation type occurrence of 11 groundwater-dependent vegetation types in Belgian lowland valley ecosystems based on spatially distributed measurements of environmental conditions. The spatially distributed data set under investigation consists of 1705 grid cells covering an area of 47.32 ha. After model construction and calibration, both models are applied to independent test data sets using two-fold cross-validation and resulting probabilities of occurrence are used to predict vegetation type distributions within the study area. Predicted vegetation types are compared with observations, and the McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model at the 0.001 significance level. Comparison of the modelling results for each individual vegetation type separately by means of the F-measure, which combines precision and recall, also reveals better predictions by the random forest model. Inspection of the probabilities of occurrence of the different vegetation types for each grid cell demonstrates that correct predictions in central areas of homogeneous vegetation sites are based on high probabilities, whereas the confidence decreases towards the margins of these areas. Threshold-independent evaluation of the model accuracy by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirms good performances of both models, but with higher values for the random forest model. Therefore, the incorporation of the random forest technique in distribution models has the ability to lead to better model performances. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Soil is very important for many land functions. To achieve sustainability it is important to understand how soils vary over space in the landscape. Remote sensing data can be instrumental in mapping and spatial modelling of soil properties, resources and their variability. The aims of this study were to compare satellite sensors (MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) with varying spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) of a set of soil properties in Scotland, evaluate the potential benefits of adding Sentinel-1 data to DSM models, select the most suited mix of sensors for DSM to map the considered set of soil properties and validate the results of topsoil (2D) and whole profile (3D) models. The results showed that the use of a mixture of sensors proved more effective to model and map soil properties than single sensors. The use of radar Sentinel-1 data proved useful for all soil properties, improving the prediction capability of models with only optical bands. The use of MODIS time series provided stronger relationships than the use of temporal snapshots. The results showed good validation statistics with a RMSE below 20{\%} of the range for all considered soil properties. The RMSE improved from previous studies including only MODIS sensor and using a coarser prediction grid. The performance of the models was similar to previous studies at regional, national or continental scale. A mix of optical and radar data proved useful to map soil properties along the profile. The produced maps of soil properties describing both lateral and vertical variability, with associated uncertainty, are important for further modelling and management of soil resources and ecosystem services. Coupled with further data the soil properties maps could be used to assess soil functions and therefore conditions and suitability of soils for a range of purposes.},

abstract = {The variation of soil properties down a profile is usually considered continuous. The aim of this study was to develop and test a methodology to model the continuous vertical and lateral distributions of SOC stocks in Scottish soils making explicit the modelling and spatial uncertainty of the results. A comparison with regression kriging and other depth function methods is provided to show that better performances can be achieved taking into account non-linear relationships between covariates and soil properties. The analysis was run for the whole of Scotland. The carbon stocks were calculated for each point, i.e. each horizon in each available profile. The stock value at each cell for each of the considered depth layers was defined using a hybrid GAM-geostatistical 3D model, combining: 1) the fitting of a GAM to estimate the trend of the variable, using a 3D smoother with related covariates; and 2) kriging or Gaussian simulations of GAM residuals as spatial component to account for local details. The use of GAM makes the approach flexible, because it is able to deal with both linear and non-linear relationships between soil properties and the considered covariates. The results confirmed that MODIS data are a useful source of information for DSM especially at national scale. When comparing the proposed approach with similar methods such as regression kriging, the results showed better agreement with the data in the validation set with a global R2 of 0.60. The median values obtained are comparable with the values reported from previous studies on stocks in Scotland using different methods. The uncertainty is large indicating a wide range of credible values for each pixel. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Knowledge of soil properties with complete area coverage is needed for policy-making, land resource management, and monitoring environmental impacts. Remote sensing offers possibilities to support Digital Soil Mapping, especially in data-poor regions. The aim of this work was to test the potential of time-series of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation and drought indices to provide relevant information to model topsoil properties in a Boreal-Atlantic region (Scotland) focussing on differentiation between soils with high and soils with low organic matter contents. For each of the three considered years, 345 MODIS data sets were included in the exploratory analysis; 15 data products for 23 dates (bi-weekly) per year. Terrain parameters derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were also included. A methodology was implemented to exploit fully the high number of covariates, to identify the band, index or product that best correlates with the soil property of interest. In particular the proposed approach i. relies on freely globally available data-sets; ii. uses statistical criteria to select the combination of covariates providing the highest predictive capability, among the data considered and available; iii. deals with both continuous (using Generalized Additive Models, GAMs) and multinomial categorical (using Random Trees) types of variables; iv. takes into account fully the spatial autocorrelation of the data; v. provides estimates of the spatial uncertainty for each pixel; and vi. is computationally efficient when compared with methods such as forward stepwise. The models fitted show a fairly good agreement with existing data sets, presenting a consistent spatial pattern. The use of MODIS data as covariates increased the predictive capabilities of GAMs using only terrain parameters. The misclassification error for organic matter classes was between 25 and 35{\%}. The assessment provided of the spatial uncertainty of the modelled values can be used in further modelling and in the assessment of consequences of climate-change and trade-off in land use changes. This approach can contribute to improving our understanding and modelling of soil processes and function over large, and relatively sparsely sampled, areas of the world. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Four tree species were harvested periodically over a 13-year period from plantations in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica: Cedrela odorata, Cordia alliodora, Hyeronima alchorneoides, and Euterpe oleracea. The soil was a well-drained, volcanic alluvium, and high fertility coupled with 4 m of annual rainfall and high temperatures led to rapid growth rates; at age 13 many individual were {\textgreater} 30 cm dbh and {\textgreater} 30 m tall. Harvested trees were dissected into their component parts: leaves, rachises (for Cedrela and Euterpe), branches, boles, and coarse roots (i.e., {\textgreater} 0.5 cm diameter). Roots of small trees were excavated in their entirety; those of large trees were harvested from a cylinder 1.0 m in diameter, immediately beneath the trunk. Large numbers of trees were sampled: 258-379 per species. Size classes sampled ranged from seedlings too small to have a dbh to trees of similar to 30 cm dbh. Two separate allometric equations (one for trees having only a basal diameter and another for trees having a dbh), with diameter squared times height as the metrics, were developed for each component of each species. Based on breaks in linear trends of In-In plots and deviations of predicted from actual values, we developed separate allometric equations, by component, for trees of different sizes. The resulting 40 equations (with one exception, involving very small trees) fit the data well and enable the user to predict biomass, by component, for each of the four species. A single (non-allometric) linear equation, combining all plant parts of all three dicot species, also fit the data well, but it would not provide either the detail or the accuracy provided by the species-specific, plant-part-specific equations. Large sample sizes, a 13-year run of data collection, and the economic and ecological importance of the species studied make this data set uniquely useful for biomass estimations and for understanding the inherent heterogeneity of tree structure in dynamic tropical environments.

abstract = {The Serra do Mar rift system is the most significant Cenozoic tectonic feature of the onshore continental area of southeastern Brazil. This system exhibits a two-fold tectonic evolution, marked by a distensive synsedimentary stage in Paleocene-Oligocene times and a strike-slip stage of post-Oligocene age. Recent investigations and re-examination of previously described outcrops in the Resende and Taubat?? Basins, depressions of the rift system, have revealed late Pleistocene sedimentary deposits also affected by strike-slip faulting of the second tectonic stage or even of a third one. In the Taubat?? Basin, some colluvium and stone-lines are faulted, with development of positive and negative flower structures. On the other hand, positive flower structures of the Resende Transpressional Zone have tilted alluvial terraces of the Para??ba do Sul valley. Both situatins are related to major E-W transcurrence. No absolute age dates are available for Taubat?? and Resende deposits. However, comparisons with the adjacent Para??ba do Sul River stratigraphy suggest that colluvium and stone-lines, as well as alluvial terraces, are of late Pleistocene age or younger. Fault plane solutions of two swarms of reservoir-induced events, close to the area concerned, had strike-slip and overthrust focal mechanisms related to an average E-W compressive regional stress direction. The similarity of the stress fields is thus strongly indicative of a neotectonic E-W compressive event that appears to have been active, at least as residual tectonism, up to the present day. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Surf Lifesaving (SLS) in Australia is an icon of local beach culture with more than 300 clubhouses distributed along the coastline. Their distribution at the interface of the terrestrial and marine environments means that assets and operations associated with SLS are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate variability and climate change from both the land and the sea. For Australia, this is particularly pertinent given that the east coast is projected to experience SLR that is higher than global average. This study describes how a probabilistic modelling approach (Bayesian belief networks (BBNs)) and participatory modelling techniques were used to help elicit information on the key adaptive capacity determinants influencing the ability of Australian SLS to implement climate change adaptation options. 10 BBNs were developed across four stakeholder workshops at four locations within Australia. Results of this participatory modelling show that most determinants of adaptive capacity broadly related to funding, knowledge, equipment, communication and community support. For each workshop, the BBNs indicated broad consensus in the beliefs of the stakeholders for these broad and perhaps well-known determinants of effective adaptation. Conversely, there was less agreement between the stakeholders regarding the more specific determinants as evidenced by the results of the sensitivity analyses and in the levels of debate between the stakeholders. This highlights that as the determinants of adaptive capacity become more nuanced, there is more likely to be an imperfect, and less likely to be a shared, understanding of the system by the stakeholders. Overall, the approach used in this study has shown to be effective in exploring adaptive capacity at the community level and to improve community understanding and awareness of coastal hazards and climate change risks.},

abstract = {The increasing demand of visiting natural areas, and the fact that these areas sometimes coincide with fragile ecosystems cause negative impacts on the environment. In recent years, visitation pressure has been increasing for all natural areas because of the popularization of ecotourism. Therefore, increasingly, it is necessary to find ways to cope with the impacts from visitation without necessarily reducing or curtailing its use. Hence, evaluation and monitoring of public use impacts are considered key tools for managing visitation. Given the above, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of public use on a trail of the Itatiaia National park, the Brejos trail, which has seen intensified use in recent years, and to provide data that can support management proposals. As a method of evaluating the conditions of the trail and its attractions, we used VIM (Visitor Impact Management). This includes the selection of impact-Ievel indicators and verifiers, the evaluation of appropriateness of selected variables, the collection of data throughout the area, the comparison of data obtained in standard or ideal situations, and the proposal of management measures. The results show that the trail is still relatively well preserved, with various drainage points made by the community that uses it, and a pronounced degree of erosion which has apparently stabilized, a few bifurcations along a total stretch of 3.5 km, and low impact on wildlife and vegetation surrounding the trail.},

Several studies highlight the importance of developing regional soil spectral libraries for digital soil mapping, but few studies report on the use of these libraries to aid digital mapping of soil types. This study aims to produce a digital soil map using as training set Visible and Near Infra-Red (Vis-NIR) spectra from local soil samples, a regional spectral library and terrain attributes. The soils were sampled in 162 locations on a 270-ha farm in the municipality of Piracicaba, S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. Spectra from topsoil and subsoil were measured in laboratory (400-2500 nm) and arranged as multi-depth spectra. Information was summarized by principal component analysis. Regression tree models were calibrated to predict principal components (PC) scores based on terrain attributes. After calibration, the models were applied to the entire study site, resulting in PC score maps. Fuzzy c-means and PC maps were used to define the soil mapping units (MU). Based on fuzzy centroids, representative samples (RS) were defined to the MU. Munsell soil color and soil order were predicted from soil spectra and used to characterize the MU. The regression tree model had a good fit for PC1, with an r2 of 0.92, and a satisfactory r2 for PC3, PC4, and PC5, respectively 0.58, 0.66 and 0.53. The fuzzy clustering defined seven MU. The R2 for Munsell color predictions were 0.94 (hue), 0.96 (value) and 0.73 (chroma). Soil order had good agreement in validation, with kappa coefficient of 0.41. The methodology indicates the potential of Vis-NIR spectra to improve soil mapping campaigns and consequently provides a product similar to a conventional soil map.},

abstract = {The spatial variability of remotely sensed image values provides important information about the arrangement of objects and their spatial relationships within the image. The characterisation of spatial variability in such images, for example, to measure of texture, is of great utility for the discrimination of land cover classes. To this end, the variogram, a function commonly applied in geostatistics, has been used widely to extract image texture for remotely sensed data classification. The aim of this study was to assess the increase in accuracy that can be achieved by incorporating univariate and multivariate textural measures of Landsat TM imagery in classification models applied to large heterogeneous landscapes. Such landscapes which difficult to classify due to the large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Madogram, rodogram and direct variogram for the univariate case, and cross- and pseudocross variograms for the multivariate one, together with multi-seasonal spectral information were used in a Random Forest classifier to map land cover types. The addition of spatial variability into multi-seasonal Random Forest models leads to an increase in the overall accuracy of 8{\%}, and to an increase in the Kappa index of 9{\%}, respectively. The increase in per categories Kappa for the textural Random Forest model reached 30{\%} for certain categories. This study demonstrates that the use of information on spatial variability produces a fundamental increase in per class classification accuracy of complex land-cover categories. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied to spectral as well as mono- and multi-seasonal textural features extracted from Landsat TM imagery to increase the accuracy of land cover classification over a complex Mediterranean landscape, with a large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Five different types of geostatistical textural measure for three different window sizes and three different lags were applied creating a total of 972 potential input variables. Madograms, rodograms and direct variograms for the univariate case and cross- and pseudo-cross variograms for the multivariate case, together with multi-seasonal spectral information, were used in a RF classifier to map the land cover types. The pseudo-cross and cross variograms were used specifically to incorporate important seasonal/temporal information. Incorporating multi-scale textural features into the RF models led to an increase in the overall index of 10.71{\%} and, for the most accurate classification, the increase was up to 30{\%} in some classes. The differences in the kappa coefficient for the textural classification models were evaluated statistically using a pairwise Z-test, revealing a significant increase in per-class classification accuracy compared to GLCM-based texture measures. The pseudo-cross variogram between the visible and near-infrared bands was the most important textural features for general classification, and the multi-seasonal pseudo-cross variogram had an outstanding importance for agricultural classes. Overall, the RF classifier applied to a reduced subset of input variables composed of the most informative textural features led to the highest accuracy. Highly reliable classification results were obtained when the 16 most important textural features calculated at single scales (window sizes) were selected and used in the classification. The proposed methodology significantly increased the classification accuracy achieved with a spectral maximum likelihood classifier (ML). The kappa values for the textural RF and ML classifications were equal to 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning.In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92{\%} overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20{\%}, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Visible near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (vis–NIR) is an increasingly popular measurement method that can provide cheaper and faster predictions of soil properties, including soil organic carbon content (SOC). The spectroscopic prediction method relies significantly on the development of regressions of data in spectral databases or libraries. While the vis–NIR estimation of SOC was developed in controlled laboratory conditions, its natural development in recent years has been to perform the vis–NIR measurements in situ, where soil spectra are recorded under field conditions. However, environmental factors, such as soil moisture content, have been shown to affect soil spectra, making the use of regressions derived using soil spectral libraries difficult. Direct standardization (DS) and external parameter orthogonalisation (EPO) are two methods that were proposed for the correction of variable moisture conditions and other environmental factors. In this study, we compared DS and EPO on a set of 150 soil samples (3 depths from each of 50 soil cores) from a farm in New Zealand. The samples were re-wetted under controlled conditions, and spectra were recorded at nine different moisture levels. Our results show that DS and EPO are two effective strategies to mitigate the effects of soil water content on vis–NIR spectra. While DS and EPO results were similar when a large number of soil cores were reserved for calibrating the moisture correction methods, SOC predictions using the EPO correction significantly outperformed those using the DS correction for a lower number of cores (5 cores, 15 samples).},

abstract = {The conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) method is a popular sampling allocation method within the digital soil mapping community, and allows soil practitioners to make use of existing information to produce an optimized sampling stratification. However, it often produces sam- pling schemes that are scattered around the landscape, resulting in plans that are costly to implement. This paper proposes to enhance the cLHS method by incorporating operational constraints into it, so that the output can be implemented in a cost-effective fashion. The cost of reaching each point in the landscape from the road network has been assessed using terrain and landcover attributes. This cost layer has then been used in the optimisation process of the cLHS algorithm to penalise the points that are difficult or impossible to reach in the field, and guide the sampling process towards schemes that are easier to imple- ment operationaly. Results are illustrated using a real example in New Zealand.},

abstract = {Different parent materials participate in the formation of soils in the$\backslash$nhilly landscape of ``Mar de Morros{\{}''{\}} in the Atlantic Forest$\backslash$nenvironment. Those derived from mafic igneous rock (gabbro) frequently$\backslash$nshow erosion problems because of land use, which is aggravated by the$\backslash$nmountainous relief and soil attributes. This study evaluated the main$\backslash$npedogenic processes of soils formed from mafic igneous rock (gabbro) in$\backslash$na toposequence in Pinheiral (RJ) by characterizing physical, chemical,$\backslash$nmineralogical and micromorphological attributes. The profiles are$\backslash$nlocated at different sections in the toposequence: summit (P1), shoulder$\backslash$n(P2), backslope (P3) and footslope (P4). They were classified according$\backslash$nto the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS) and correlated to$\backslash$nSoil Taxonomy. The soil morphology of profiles P2, P3 and P4 is$\backslash$nexpressed by a brownish-red color, blocky structure with high to$\backslash$nmoderate development, clay films and clay loam to clay texture, with a$\backslash$ntextural B horizon. P1 shows less development, with a shallow profile$\backslash$nand the sequence of horizons A-C-Cr. The soils have a slightly low$\backslash$ndegree of weathering, identified by the presence of pyroxenes and$\backslash$nfeldspars in the sand fraction and montorillonite in the clay fraction;$\backslash$nthe sum of bases is from 15 to 24 cmol(c) kg(-1); and cation exchange$\backslash$ncapacity (CEC) is from 12 to 22 cmol(c) kg(-1). A significant presence$\backslash$nof clay skins was observed in the field and was confirmed by thin$\backslash$nsection analysis, which showed features such as argillans,$\backslash$nferriargillans and iron nodules. The soil profile at the summit (P1) was$\backslash$nclassified as Neossolo Regolitico Ortico (Typic Udorthents), and the$\backslash$nother profiles as Chernossolo Argiluvicos Orticos (Typic Argiudolls).},

abstract = {The development of conservation ideal and the rise of tourist modalities such as ecotourism and geotourism increased the interest of urban populations for natural areas. This increase visitation in areas of environmental preservation is positive with respect to the disclosure of biotic and abiotic heritage. However, access to this type of attraction is mostly done through trails, and the increasing use of them can act as vectors for the spread of many environmental disturbances, such as exposure, compaction and soil erosion. To understand these processes of degradation of trails was used as the study area of the Carteiro trail, located at Serra S{\~{a}}o Jos{\'{e}} Environmental Protection Area, in the Tiradentes county, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The analysis is based on the use of the method of Cross Sectional Area (CSA), and estimation of soil compaction in the bed and on the edges of the trail. Were separated several checkpoints along the trail, where the methodology proposed was applied. These sections were analyzed, yielding values of soil loss in square centimeters and compaction rates in megapascals},

abstract = {Logistic regression is a particular instance of a broader kind of model, called a gener-alized linear model (GLM). You are familiar, of course, from your regression class with the idea of transforming the response variable, what we've been calling Y , and then predicting the transformed variable from X . This was not what we did in logis-tic regression. Rather, we transformed the conditional expected value, and made that a linear function of X . This seems odd, because it is odd, but it turns out to be useful. Let's be specific. Our usual focus in regression modeling has been the condi-tional expectation function, r (x) = E [Y |X = x]. In plain linear regression, we try to approximate r (x) by $\beta$ 0 + x {\textperiodcentered} $\beta$. In logistic regression, r (x) = E [Y |X = x] = Pr (Y = 1|X = x), and it is a transformation of r (x) which is linear. The usual nota-tion says $\eta$(x) = $\beta$ 0 + xc ˙ $\beta$ (13.1) $\eta$(x) = log r (x) 1 − r (x) (13.2) = g (r (x)) (13.3) defining the logistic link function by g (m) = log m/(1 − m). The function $\eta$(x) is called the linear predictor. Now, the naive strategy for estimating this model would be to all the transforma-tion g to the response. But Y is always zero or one, so g (Y) = ±∞, and regression will not be helpful here. The standard strategy is instead to use (what else?) Taylor expansion. Specifically, we try expanding g (Y) around r (x), and stop at first order: g (Y) ≈ g (r (x)) + (Y − r (x)) g {\"{i}}¿¿ (r (x)) (13.4)},

Thirty-one soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm from georeferenced collection points. We determined total organic carbon (TOC), particulate carbon (COp), carbon associated with clay and silt (COam), carbon content in the fulvic acid fraction (C-FAF), humic acid fraction (C-HAF) and humin fraction (C-HUM). Semivariogram analysis and model adjustment were carried out using ArcGIS 10.2 software. Subsequently, spatial interpolation was performed using Ordinary Kriging. We observed spatial dependence for all variables except for TOC and COp at the 0-10 cm depth, which presented a pure nugget effect. It was possible to observe modifications in the distribution of humic substances in the study area. The results from this study are similar to those of other studies conducted in naive areas in the Atlantic Forest, demonstrating the benefits of using the agroforestry system.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to spatialize the chemical and physical attributes of the soil in an agroforestry system in Serop{\'{e}}dica, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Thirty-one soil samples were collected from 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-40 cm depths, and each sampling point was georeferenced. The pH (in H2O), potential acidity (H+Al), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), aluminum (Al+3), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), phosphorus (P), organic carbon (C), cation exchange capacity of the soil (T value), base saturation (V value), total clay, total sand, silt, and density of fine roots were measured. The software ArcGIS 10.2 was used to perform the semivariogram analysis and the fitting of the models, and spatial interpolation was performed using a first-order trend ordinary kriging process with spherical, exponential, and Gaussian spatial models. Based on the results, only the exponential and Gaussian models were fitted to the variables, except for the Mg2+ and V value variables, which presented no spatial dependence, thus showing a pure nugget effect (PNE). Distribution maps were generated for the variables (except for those exhibiting PNE), which showed correlation between the variables pH and Al3+, organic carbon and cations, phosphorus and total clay, and silt and sand. Overall, geostatistics could be applied to spatialize the chemical and physical attributes of the soil in the agroforestry system, except in the case of Mg2+ and the V value.},

abstract = {Whereas contemporary land use and land management planning require specific and quantitative georeferenced soil information, often only general-purpose and qualitative soil maps are available. With a view to fill this gap for topsoil clay and organic carbon content in the central plateaus of Burundi, we tested for a representative 15km2 hilly landscape, six types of SCORPAN models. The SCORPAN models were first applied as standalone trend models and next extended with a component accounting for the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals from the trend. Various sets of predictors, including class variables derived from the available soil map and continuous derivatives from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and from Landsat-imagery were incorporated. For clay, the best prediction method was a Residual Kriging (RK) using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) as trend built with only DEM derivatives and spectral normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Furthermore, the classical and simplest RK, i.e. using a Least Squares Linear Regression (LR) trend built with only continuous covariates, outperformed all standalone trend models. For organic carbon, residuals from the trend models were not significantly auto-correlated, making RK meaningless. In this case the best model was a GAM combining lithologic units with DEM derivatives and NDVI. Overall, the contribution of soil map???derived predictors to the model performance was rather weak. It was concluded that, for prediction of specific soil characteristics in the study area, a SCORPAN approach is preferred the more as the performance can be boosted by kriging of trend residuals if auto-correlated.},

abstract = {Highland environments favor accumulation and preservation of soil organic matter (SOM) due to low temperatures, leading to the formation of Histosols. The Itatiaia National Park (INP), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, offers conditions for preservation of SOM deposited over time, which has led to the formation of these soils. The objective of this study was to characterize Histosols in this environment, with the premise that it may provide evidence of changes in vegetation. Organossolos (Histosols) were sampled, characterized, described, and analyzed for their properties, stable isotopes of 12 C and 13 C, 14 N and 15 N, and dating of organic matter through 14 C. The soils were classified in the Brazilian Soil Classification System as Organossolo H{\'{a}}plico H{\^{e}}mico t{\'{i}}pico - RJ-01 (Haplohemists) and Organossolo F{\'{o}}lico S{\'{a}}prico cambiss{\'{o}}lico - RJ-02 (Udifolists). The morphological properties, degree of transformation, and chemical fractioning of SOM were consistent with hemic and sapric materials. The $\delta$13 C and $\delta$15 N isotopic analyses showed a difference in the contribution of plant materials. In RJ-01, there was previous influence of algae, due to poor drainage, and depletion of $\delta$13 C, suggesting a mix of C3 and C4 plants. RJ-02 showed influence of C3 type plants. The 14 C dating for RJ-01 was 3280±80},

abstract = {A variety of landscape properties have been modelled successfully using topographic indices such as the topographic wetness index (TWI), defined as ln(a/tan $\beta$), where a is the specific upslope area and $\beta$ is the surface slope. Previous studies have shown the influence of scale on TWI values when converting standard-resolution DEMs to coarser resolutions. In this study a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with a 5 m grid size derived from LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data was used to investigate the scale-dependency of TWI values when converting from high-resolution elevation data to standard-resolution DEMs. First, a set of DEMs was generated from an initial DEM by thinning to resolutions of 10, 25, and 50 m grid sizes to study the effects of lower grid size and decreased information content. Next, to investigate the impact of different information content on DEMs with the same grid size, the three lower resolution DEMs were all interpolated to the original 5 m grid size. In addition to comparing index distribution functions, a second objective was to evaluate differences in spatial patterns. Thus the values of TWI and its components as computed for the seven different DEMs were compared in three different ways: (1) distribution functions and their statistics; (2) cell by cell comparison of four DEMs with the same resolution but different information content; and (3) comparison of blocks of cells within different resolution DEMs with different information content. Like previous TWI studies, the computed specific upstream area decreased on average for higher resolution DEMs while computed slope values followed a narrower distribution. TWI variation between neighbouring cells in 50 × 50 m areas decreased largely with increasing grid size. A cell by cell comparison of the TWI values of the four 5 m DEMs with different information content showed a clear decrease in correlation with the TWI based on the original DEM with decreasing information content. The results showed considerable differences between topographic indices computed for DEMs of different grid resolution. Interpolating the DEMs to a higher resolution (i.e. a smaller grid size) provided more similar TWI distributions, but the pixel by pixel comparison showed that different information contents caused clearly different TWI maps. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: This paper deals with the challenge in modeling environmental fragility, which implies not only the understanding of the intrinsic and dynamic relationship between the physical, biotic and socio-economic components of environmental systems, but also in trying to translate this knowledge in mathematical models. In order to shed some light on this difficulty, the results generated by two empirical models of environmental fragility were presented and compared, models that are widely used (CREPANI et al. 2001 and ROSS, 1994). These two models were applied in two thesis-areas with very diverging results. Within this context of uncertainties, this paper tested the feasibility and reliability of a new tool that can be applied in the elaboration of environmental fragility models, the artificial neural networks. For that, were used the knowledge and experience of specialists in this area. The results proved that it is possible to emulate, with reasonable reliability, the evaluation pattern of specialists in the definition of environmental systems fragility, eliminating in this way, the arbitrariness and subjectivity in the elaboration process of environmental fragility models. This work does not present a new model, but rather a methodology for the construction of models using artificial neural networks, taking the first step in the search of new techniques, sometimes feared by the geographers, however necessary for the evolution of the geographic science.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. RESULTS: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. CONCLUSION: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing.

abstract = {Landslide inventory mapping is an indispensable prerequisite for reliable hazard and risk analysis, and with the increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery the creation and updating of such inventories on regular bases and directly after major events is becoming possible. The diversity of landslide processes and spectral similarities of affected areas with other landscape elements pose major challenges for automated image processing, and time-consuming manual image interpretation and field surveys are still the most commonly applied mapping techniques. Taking advantage of recent advances in object-oriented image analysis (OOA) and machine learning algorithms, a supervised workflow is proposed in this study to reduce manual labor and objectify the choice of significant object features and classification thresholds. A sequence of image segmentation, feature selection, object classification and error balancing was developed and tested on a variety of sample datasets (Quickbird, IKONOS, Geoeye-1, aerial photographs) of four sites in the northern hemisphere recently affected by landslides (Haiti, Italy, China, France). Besides object metrics, such as band ratios and slope, newly introduced topographically-guided texture measures were found to enhance significantly the classification, and also feature selection revealed positive influence on the overall performance. With an iterative procedure to examine the class-imbalance within the training sample it was furthermore possible to compensate spurious effects of class-imbalance and class-overlap on the balance of the error rates. Employing approximately 20{\%} of the data for training, the proposed workflow resulted in accuracies between 73{\%} and 87{\%} for the affected areas, and approximately balanced commission and omission errors. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Most calibration sampling designs for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) demarcate spatially distinct sample sites. In practical applications major challenges are often limited field accessibility and the question on how to integrate legacy soil samples to cope with usually scarce resources for field sampling and laboratory analysis. The study focuses on the development and application of an efficiency improved DSM sampling design that (1) applies an optimized sample set size, (2) compensates for limited field accessibility, and (3) enables the integration of legacy soil samples. The proposed sampling design represents a modification of conditioned Latin Hypercube Sam- pling (cLHS), which originally returns distinct sample sites to optimally cover a soil related covari- ate space and to preserve the correlation of the covariates in the sample set. The sample set size was determined by comparing multiple sample set sizes of original cLHS sets according to their representation of the covariate space. Limited field accessibility and the integration of leg- acy samples were incorporated by providing alternative sample sites to replace the original cLHS sites. We applied the modified cLHS design (cLHSadapt) in a small catchment (4.2 km2)in Central China to model topsoil sand fractions using Random Forest regression (RF). For evaluat- ing the proposed approach, we compared cLHSadapt with the original cLHS design (cLHSorig). With an optimized sample set size n = 30, the results show a similar representation of the cLHS covariate space between cLHSadapt and cLHSorig, while the correlation between the covariates is preserved (r = 0.40 vs. r = 0.39). Furthermore, we doubled the sample set size of cLHSadapt by adding available legacy samples (cLHSadapt+) and compared the prediction accuracies. Based on an external validation set cLHSval (n = 20), the coefficient of determination (R2) of the cLHSadapt predictions range between 0.59 and 0.71 for topsoil sand fractions. The R2-values of the RF predictions based on cLHSadapt+, using additional legacy samples, are marginally in- creased on average by 5{\%}},

abstract = {Regression-kriging (RK) is becoming an important tool in geostatistics because of the availability of many covariates at high spatial resolution with the advancement in proximal and remote-sensing with positioning technologies. This paper presents the application of a new local RK algorithm for prediction of soil properties. The algorithm was tested using 985 observations for prediction of soil pH, clay content and carbon content in the lower Hunter Valley of New South Wales in Australia. Environmental covariates for the area were compiled. First, the covariates used in regression analysis for each of the soil properties were obtained through a step-wise regression analysis. Secondly, different spatial prediction methods were examined. Finally, the prediction efficiency of various techniques was tested at validation sites using the standardised squared deviation as a measure of the goodness of theoretical estimates. The results from validation showed that the local RK method does not always present the best predictions, but for specific cases it may be highly accurate. We conclude that local RK performance depends on the actual soil and environmental factor relationships, and in general performs no worse than global RK. Furthermore, the advantage of local RK is that it can provide an approach to understand how much the regression models and variogram models change across a region. We have developed a software programme named RKGuider to carry out the local RK steps automatically. Further investigation and numerous datasets are required to verify the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A new classification and regression tool, Random Forest, is introduced and investigated for predicting a compound's quantitative or categorical biological activity based on a quantitative description of the compound's molecular structure. Random Forest is an ensemble of unpruned classification or regression trees created by using bootstrap samples of the training data and random feature selection in tree induction. Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging) the predictions of the ensemble. We built predictive models for six cheminformatics data sets. Our analysis demonstrates that Random Forest is a powerful tool capable of delivering performance that is among the most accurate methods to date. We also present three additional features of Random Forest: built-in performance assessment, a measure of relative importance of descriptors, and a measure of compound similarity that is weighted by the relative importance of descriptors. It is the combination of relatively high prediction accuracy and its collection of desired features that makes Random Forest uniquely suited for modeling in cheminformatics.},

abstract = {This study aimed to map SOC lateral, and vertical variations down to 1m depth in a semi-arid region in Kurdistan Province, Iran. Six data mining techniques namely; artificial neural networks, support vector regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forests, regression tree models, and genetic programming were combined with equal-area smoothing splines to develop, evaluate and compare their effectiveness in achieving this aim. Using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 188 soil profiles in the study area were sampled and soil organic carbon content (SOC) measured. Eighteen ancillary data variables derived from a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 images were used to represent predictive soil forming factors in this study area. Findings showed that normalized difference vegetation index and wetness index were the most useful ancillary data for SOC mapping in the upper (0-15cm) and bottom (60-100cm) of soil profiles, respectively. According to 5-fold cross-validation, artificial neural networks (ANN) showed the highest performance for prediction of SOC in the four standard depths compared to all other data mining techniques. ANNs resulted in the lowest root mean square error and highest Lin's concordance coefficient which ranged from 0.07 to 0.20 log (kg/m3) and 0.68 to 0.41, respectively, with the first value in each range being for the top of the profile and second for the bottom. Furthermore, ANNs increased performance of spatial prediction compared to the other data mining algorithms by up to 36, 23, 21 and 13{\%} for each soil depth, respectively, starting from the top of the profile. Overall, results showed that prediction of subsurface SOC variation needs improvement and the challenge remains to find appropriate covariates that can explain it.},

abstract = {Digital soil mapping involves the use of auxiliary data to assist in the mapping of soil classes. In this research, we investigate the predictive power of 6 data mining classifiers, namely Logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), random forest (RF), and decision tree model (DTM) to create a DSM across an area covering of 3000. ha in Kurdistan Province, north-west Iran. In this area, using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 217 soil profiles were selected, sampled, analysed and allocated to taxonomic classes according to Soil Taxonomy up to family level. To test the user accuracy (UA) we established a calibration and validation set (70:30{\%}). Of the 5 soil family classes we map, the highest overall accuracy (0.71) and kappa index (0.69) are achieved using the DTA and ANN method. More specifically, the UA of prediction was up to 18.33{\%} better in comparison to LR. Moreover, our results showed that no improvement was obtained in prediction accuracy of DTA algorithm with minimizing taxonomic distance compared to minimizing misclassification error (0.71). Overall, our results suggest that the developed methodology could be used to predict soil classes in the other regions of Iran.},

After defining environmental vulnerability criteria and factors, IDRISI 32's decision making routines were applied. The factors were standardized to a common numeric range (0 to 255) and then combined by means of a weighted average (weighted linear combination – WLC) to obtain the relative environmental vulnerability map. This map shows a range of continuous values varying from 0 (low vulnerability) to 255 (high vulnerability). The methodology, as well as the computational analysis tool are very flexible helping to reach a technical consensus or a decision making, which are very important aspects to integrated coastal zone management programs.},

abstract = {The accuracy of digital elevation models (DEM) and DEM-derived products depends on several factors, including the horizontal resolution and vertical precision at which the elevation data are represented, and the source of the elevation data. This accuracy becomes increasingly important as we extend the use of DEM data for spatial prediction of soil attributes. Our objective was to compare terrain attributes and quantitative soil-landscape models derived from grid-based DEM represented at different horizontal resolutions (10 and 30 m), represented at different vertical precisions (0.1 and 1 m), and acquired from different sources. Decreasing the horizontal resolution of the field survey DEM produced lower slope gradients on steeper slopes, steeper slope gradients on flatter slopes, narrower ranges in curvatures, larger specific catchment areas in upper landscape positions, and lower specific catchment areas values in lower landscape positions. Overall, certain landscape features were less discernible on the 30-m DEM than on the 10-m DEM. Decreased vertical precision produced a large proportion of points with zero slope gradient and zero slope curvature, and a large number of steeply sloping and more highly curved areas. Differences among DEM from different sources were more significant, with less accurate representation of depressions and drainage pathways with the USGS DEM as compared to the field survey DEM. Empirical models developed from different DEM included similar predictive terrain attributes, and were equally successful in predicting A-horizon depth (AHD) in the validation data set. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Protected natural areas are often subjected to severe human impacts including recreational-related impacts. Walking, hiking, horse riding, bicycling and backpacking are the most popular outdoor recre- ational activities in many protected areas. Trampling of vegetation and soil erosion are two main indi- cators of trail impact. Understanding and modelling factors related to trail and forest road degradation are crucial to park managers, who are responsible for the preservation of natural conditions and the maintenance of recreational opportunities. It is usually impossible to make direct measurements of all the factors that determine the trail impact. Hence, the use of GIS modelling to assess environmental sensitivity is encouraged. In this study, two variables have been used (1 e vulnerability of plant communities to trampling; 2 e vulnerability of soil to erosion processes) to assess the spatial distribution of areas with diversified degrees of environmental sensitivity to trail impact. These variables can be relatively easily collected and spatially modelled using GIS. The model presented in the study is simple and can be easily calculated with limited data. Although 50{\%} of the area of the Gorce National Park has potentially medium or low environmental sensitivity to trail impact, over 36{\%} of its recreational trails and forest roads are constructed in sensitive areas. These roads are highly susceptible to gully erosion. One result of the model used in this study is the qualitative assessment of environmental sensitivity. Although it does not provide quantitative results (e.g. a maximum allowed number of tourists per day), it allows to study the spatial distribution of environmental vulnerability and to compare selected areas. For example, results provided by the proposed methodology can be used to determine which areas are resilient and therefore are predisposed to recreational use, and which are vulnerable and should be protected from severe human impact. ?},

abstract = {This study applied a newmethod for detailed surveys of short-termdynamics in the surface of recreational trails. Themain objectives of this studywere: (1) to analyze the spatial aspect of surface changes inmicroscale; (2) to quantify precisely the short-term rate of soil loss and deposition. Measurements were taken in 12 test fields, located in two protected natural areas in the south of Poland: the Gorce National Park and Poprad Landscape Park. The measuring places were located on trails characterized by different slopes, types of vegetation, and types of use. Each of the test fields was established by four special marks, firmly dug into the ground. The use of precise elevation data provided by the electronic total station and digital elevation models (DEMs) of differ- ence allowed us to assess the sediment budget of the surface changes. The proposed method allowed for obtaining information not only for profile lines but also for specified areas. In such a way, the spatial and temporal dynamics of geomorphologic processes influencing the trail tread could be studied. During a two-year period (2008–2010), soil loss dominated within 10 test fields, while a predominance of deposition was recorded for the remaining two. The average net volumetric change of the trail surface varied from−0.035 m3 m−2 per year to+0.005 m3 m−2 per year. The short-term dynam- ics was high and several test fields had a positive balance (predominance of deposition) in one period and negative balance (predominance of soil loss) in the next period. Local geomorphic conditions, morphology of the trail tread and soil properties seemed to be the most important factors contributing to the relief trans- formation. No connection was demonstrated between the amount of use (i.e. number of visitors) or type of use and the amount of soil loss or deposition. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {One of the most important tasks for managers of many natural protected areas is achieving a balance between conservation of nature and recreational opportunity. This paper presents a framework based on geographic information system (GIS) and regression tree analysis of optimized recreational trail location for flexible, user-defined input parameters. The method utilizes: (1) the GIS to create a database con- taining field data and existing GIS/cartographic materials; (2) regression tree analysis to establish the relationships between indicators of degradation and environmental and use-related factors for existing trails, as well as to predict trail degradation for potential new trials; (3) least-cost path algorithm within a GIS framework to optimize trail route. The frameworkwas applied to the Gorce National Park in the south of Poland. A large sample ({\textgreater}4500) of the field collected data about degradation of the existing trail networkwas linked with data about soil, geology, geomorphology and relief, and with information about the type and amount of recreational use. Based on the existing relationship, predicted trail degradation was calculated and routes for two ex- amples of trails (hiking and motorized) were designated. The proposed methodology is objective and quantitative, and can also include knowledge of local stakeholders. The framework has the potential to design new trails (or to re-route old ones), characterized by the best possible solution for recreational and conservation functions to coexist, by routing visitors through trails with the lowest possible impact.},

abstract = {Robust and accurate regional estimates of C storage in soils are currently an important research topic because of ongoing debate about human-induced changes in the terrestrial C cycle. Widely available geoprocessing tools were applied to estimate native soil organic C (SOC) stocks of Rio Grande do Sul state in southern Brazil to a depth of 30 cm from previously sampled soil pedons under undisturbed vegetation. The study used a statewide comprehensive soil survey comprising a small-scale soil map, a climate map, and a soil pedon database. Soil organic C stocks under native vegetation were calculated with two different approaches: the Tier 1 method of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a refi ned method based on actual fi eld measurements derived from soil profi le data. Highest SOC stocks occurred in Neossolos Quartzar{\^{e}}nico hidrom{\'{o}}rfi co (Aquents), Organossolos Tiom{\'{o}}rfi cos (Hemists), Latossolos Brunos (Udox), and Vertissolos Eb{\^{a}}nicos (Uderts) soil classes. Before human use of soils, most C was stored in the Latossolos Vermelhos (Udox) and Neossolos Regol{\'{i}}ticos (Orthents), which occupy a large area of Rio Grande do Sul. Generally, IPCC default reference SOC stocks compared well with SOC stocks calculated from soil pedons. The total SOC stock of Rio Grande do Sul was estimated at 1510.3 Tg C (5.8 kg C m−2) by the IPPC method and 1597.5 ± 363.9 Tg C (7.4 ± 1.9 kg C m−2) calculated from soil pedons. The SOC digital map and SOC database developed in this study provide crucial background information for state-level contemporary assessment of C stocks and soil C sequestration programs and initiatives.

The aim of this study was to determine the composition, structure and floristic similarity of arboreal flora among three forest types of Atlantic Forest (Alluvial, Montane and Cloud Forest) and also the similarity with other studies. A total of 2,572 individuals was sampled, from 194 species, 59 families and 118 genera. The highest number of species was recorded in the families Myrtaceae (30 morphospecies), Lauraceae (20), Melastomataceae (17) and Fabaceae (13). The three vegetation types associated with different environmental conditions differ in their composition and structure. The alluvial proved with low diversity and stature and high ecological dominance. The cloud forest stood out for its typical elements of altitude over other common species in the area below the range, where diversity was higher. The tree flora of Sierra Negra presents various indicator species to characteristic distribution of highlands of southeastern Brazil.},

This selection aimed at data potential for geomorphometric derivations, given by the preservation of detailed geometric characteristics of the resulting digital elevation models (DEM), which are sensitive to refining procedures. The development contained a long-term experimentation stage, when data refinement through kriging was locally developed to support distinct regional projects, followed by a unified selection stage, where the acquired experience was applied to select a single and unified interpolation scheme. In this stage, the selected geostatistical models with promising performances were tested for unified refinement on 40 Brazilian areas with distinct geological settings. Tested areas encompass reliefs varying from mountainous to plain. The effects of data preparation were observed on the perception of patterns (texture and roughness), as well as of singularities (edges, peaks, thalwegs etc.). Results were evaluated mainly through the examination of shaded reliefs, transects and perspectives observed in different scales. Terrains with low slopes and small amplitudes had their DEM promptly affected by the refining methods, as opposed to mountainous terrains. The evaluation, unambiguously confirmed by all consulted interpreters, converged into a refining model with outstanding performance in all tested conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of soil carbon (C) is controlled by ecological processes that evolve and interact over a range of spatial scales across the landscape. The relationships between hydrologic and biotic processes and soil C patterns and spatial behavior are still poorly understood. Our objectives were to (i) identify the appropriate spatial scale to observe soil total C (TC) in a subtropical landscape with pronounced hydrologic and biotic variation, and (ii) investigate the spatial behavior and relationships between TC and ecological landscape variables which aggregate various hydrologic and biotic processes. The study was conducted in Florida, USA, characterized by extreme hydrologic (poorly to excessively drained soils), and vegetation/land use gradients ranging from natural uplands and wetlands to intensively managed forest, agricultural, and urban systems. We used semivariogram and landscape indices to compare the spatial dependence structures of TC and 19 ecological landscape variables, identifying similarities and establishing pattern-process relationships. Soil, hydrologic, and biotic ecological variables mirrored the spatial behavior of TC at fine (few kilometers), and coarse (hundreds of kilometers) spatial scales. Specifically, soil available water capacity resembled the spatial dependence structure of TC at escalating scales, supporting a multi-scale soil hydrology-soil C process-pattern relationship in Florida. Our findings suggest two appropriate scales to observe TC, one at a short range (autocorrelation range of 5.6 km), representing local soil-landscape variation, and another at a longer range (119 km), accounting for regional variation. Moreover, our results provide further guidance to measure ecological variables influencing C dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Topography is an important land-surface characteristic that affects most aspects of the water balance in a catchment, including the generation of surface and sub-surface runoff; the flow paths followed by water as it moves down and through hillslopes and the rate of water movement. All of the spatially explicit fully distributed hydraulic and hydrological models use topography (represented by the DEM of the area modelled) to derive bathymetry. DEM is also used to derive some other key information critical in fully distributed hydraulic and hydrological models.With high-resolution DEMs such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) becoming more readily available and also with the advancements in computing facilities which can handle these large data sets, there is a need to quantify the impact of using different resolution DEMs (e.g. 1 m against 10 m or 25 m) on hydrologically important variables and the loss of accuracy and reliability of the results as we move from high resolution to coarser resolution.The results from statistical analysis carried out to compare field survey elevations with the LiDAR DEM-derived elevations, show that there are small differences between the two data sets but LiDAR DEM is a reasonably good representation of the actual ground surface compared to other commonly used DEMs derived from contour maps.The results from the analysis clearly show that the accuracy and resolution of the input DEM have serious implications on the values of the hydrologically important spatial indices derived from the DEM. The result also indicates that the loss of details by re-sampling the higher resolution DEM to coarser resolution are much less compared to the details captured in the commonly available coarse resolution DEM derived from contour maps. Topographic indices based on contour derived DEMs should be used with caution and where available, the higher resolution DEM should be used instead of the coarse resolution one. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Random forests (RF) has become a popular technique for classification, prediction, studying variable importance, variable selection, and outlier detection. There are numerous application examples of RF in a variety of fields. Several large scale comparisons including RF have been performed. There are numerous articles, where variable importance evaluations based on the variable importance measures available from RF are used for data exploration and understanding. Apart from the literature survey in RF area, this paper also presents results of new tests regarding variable rankings based on RF variable importance measures. We studied experimentally the consistency and generality of such rankings. Results of the studies indicate that there is no evidence supporting the belief in generality of such rankings. A high variance of variable importance evaluations was observed in the case of small number of trees and small data sets. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Soil C is the largest pool of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere, and yet the processes of C accumulation, transformation and loss are poorly accounted for. This, in part, is due to the fact that soil C is not uniformly distributed through the soil depth profile and most current landscape level predictions of C do not adequately account the vertical distribution of soil C. In this study, we apply a method based on simple soil specific depth functions to map the soil C stock in three-dimensions at landscape scale. We used soil C and bulk density data from the Soil Survey for England and Wales to map an area in the West Midlands region of approximately 13,948km2. We applied a method which describes the variation through the soil profile and interpolates this across the landscape using well established soil drivers such as relief, land cover and geology. The results indicate that this mapping method can effectively reproduce the observed variation in the soil profiles samples. The mapping results were validated using cross validation and an independent validation. The cross-validation resulted in an R2 of 36{\%} for soil C and 44{\%} for BULKD. These results are generally in line with previous validated studies. In addition, an independent validation was undertaken, comparing the predictions against the National Soil Inventory (NSI) dataset. The majority of the residuals of this validation are between ±5{\%} of soil C. This indicates high level of accuracy in replicating topsoil values. In addition, the results were compared to a previous study estimating the carbon stock of the UK. We discuss the implications of our results within the context of soil C loss factors such as erosion and the impact on regional C process models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation that causes soil densification and distortion that can lead to changes in three-dimensional soil structure variability. For this reason we proposed a method for mapping compaction in three-dimensional space (3D), based on simple soil-specific depth functions. This method, denoted the 'top down' method, is based on a multi-step approach that starts with a framework for selecting the best depth function, considers which shape best describes the soil-specific variation by depth and ends with an interpolation of the coefficients of the function across the field. Subsequently, for each interpolated point this function is solved in order to estimate compaction in 3D space. The top down method was evaluated using a cone resistance dataset, collected at the CULS (Czech University of Life Sciences) farm in Lany. The accuracy of this method in predicting cone-index variation in the 3D space was compared with the generally accepted 3D ordinary kriging interpolation, using descriptive statistics of the predicted values and cross validation. We found that the top down method better represented observed information and generally performs better than 3D kriging with a far smaller sample size. The cross validation results suggest that ordinary kriging can predict cone-index obtaining a value of root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 0.54 at 10{\%} soil profiles excluded, and 0.57 at 50{\%} exclusion; on the contrary the top down mapping method obtains an RMSD value of just 0.47, at 10{\%} exclusion, and 0.53, with 50{\%} exclusion. We also found that the depth function method was more representative of the observed variability in the predicted dataset, avoiding the smoothing filtering effect typical of kriging interpolation. We then created a cone-index map of the CULS Lany field with a vertical resolution of 10. cm using the top down method. The map can be seen as a series of three videos where it is possible to observe the cone-index pattern in three-dimensions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil provides ecosystem services, supports human health and habitation, stores carbon and regulates emissions of greenhouse gases. Unprecedented pressures on soil from degradation and urbanization are threatening agro-ecological balances and food security. It is important that we learn more about soil to sustainably manage and preserve it for future generations. To this end, we developed and analyzed a global soil visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectral library. It is currently the largest and most diverse database of its kind. We show that the information encoded in the spectra can describe soil composition and be associated to land cover and its global geographic distribution, which acts as a surrogate for global climate variability. We also show the usefulness of the global spectra for predicting soil attributes such as soil organic and inorganic carbon, clay, silt, sand and iron contents, cation exchange capacity, and pH. Using wavelets to treat the spectra, which were recorded in different laboratories using different spectrometers and methods, helped to improve the spectroscopic modelling. We found that modelling a diverse set of spectra with a machine learning algorithm can find the local relationships in the data to produce accurate predictions of soil properties. The spectroscopic models that we derived are parsimonious and robust, and using them we derived a harmonized global soil attribute dataset, which might serve to facilitate research on soil at the global scale. This spectroscopic approach should help to deal with the shortage of data on soil to better understand it and to meet the growing demand for information to assess and monitor soil at scales ranging from regional to global. New contributions to the library are encouraged so that this work and our collaboration might progress to develop a dynamic and easily updatable database with better global coverage. We hope that this work will reinvigorate our community's discussion towards larger, more coordinated collaborations. We also hope that use of the database will deepen our understanding of soil so that we might sustainably manage it and extend the research outcomes of the soil, earth and environmental sciences towards applications that we have not yet dreamed of.},

abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) are representations of topography with inherent errors that constitute uncertainty. DEM data are often used in analyses without quantifying the effects of these errors. This paper describes a Monte Carlo methodology for evaluation of the effects of uncertainty on elevation and derived topographic parameters. Four methods for representing DEM uncertainty that utilize meta- data and spatial characteristics of a DEM are presented. Seven statistics derived from simulation results were used to quantify the effect of DEM error. When uncertainty was quantified by the average relative absolute difference, ele- vation did not deviate. The range of deviation across the four methods for slope was 5 to 8 percent, 460 to 950 percent for derived catchment areas and 4 to 9 percent for the topographic index. This research demonstrates how application of this methodology can address DEM uncer- tainty, contributing to more responsible use of elevation and derived topographic parameters, and ultimately results obtained from their use.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of ecosystem health, with a great potential to affect climate change. This study aimed to develop, evaluate, and compare the performance of support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF) models in predicting and mapping SOC stocks in the Eastern Mau Forest Reserve, Kenya. Auxiliary data, including soil sampling, climatic, topographic, and remotely-sensed data were used for model calibration. The calibrated models were applied to create prediction maps of SOC stocks that were validated using independent testing data. The results showed that the models overestimated SOC stocks. Random forest model with a mean error (ME) of -6.5 Mg C ha-1 had the highest tendency for overestimation, while SVR model with an ME of -4.4 Mg C ha-1 had the lowest tendency. Support vector regression model also had the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (14.9 Mg C ha-1 and 0.6, respectively); hence, it was the best method to predict SOC stocks. Artificial neural network predictions followed closely with RMSE, ME, and R2 values of 15.5, -4.7, and 0.6, respectively. The three prediction maps broadly depicted similar spatial patterns of SOC stocks, with an increasing gradient of SOC stocks from east to west. The highest stocks were on the forest-dominated western and north-western parts, while the lowest stocks were on the cropland-dominated eastern part. The most important variable for explaining the observed spatial patterns of SOC stocks was total nitrogen concentration. Based on the close performance of SVR and ANN models, we proposed that both models should be calibrated, and then the best result applied for spatial prediction of target soil properties in other contexts.},

abstract = {Spatial prediction of soil organic matter is a global challenge and of particular importance for regions with intensive land use and where availability of soil data is limited. This study evaluated a Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approach to model the spatial distribution of stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), total carbon (Ctot), total nitrogen (Ntot) and total sulphur (Stot) for a data-sparse, semi-arid catchment in Inner Mongolia, Northern China. Random Forest (RF) was used as a new modeling tool for soil properties and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) as an additional method for the analysis of variable importance. At 120 locations soil profiles to 1 m depth were analyzed for soil texture, SOC, Ctot, Ntot, Stot, bulk density (BD) and pH. On the basis of a digital elevation model, the catchment was divided into pixels of 90 m × 90 m and for each cell, predictor variables were determined: land use unit, Reference Soil Group (RSG), geological unit and 12 topography-related variables. Prediction maps showed that the highest amounts of SOC, Ctot, Ntot and Stot stocks are stored under marshland, steppes and mountain meadows. River-like structures of very high elemental stocks in valleys within the steppes are partly responsible for the high amounts of SOC for grasslands (81–84{\%} of total catchment stocks). Analysis of variable importance showed that land use, RSG and geology are the most important variables influencing SOC storage. Prediction accuracy of the RF modeling and the generated maps was acceptable and explained variances of 42 to 62{\%} and 66 to 75{\%}, respectively. A decline of up to 70{\%} in elemental stocks was calculated after conversion of steppe to arable land confirming the risk of rapid soil degradation if steppes are cultivated. Thus their suitability for agricultural use is limited.},

abstract = {In environmental soil-landscape modeling (ESLM), the selection of predictive variables is commonly contingent on the researchers' domain expertise on soil-environment processes. This variable selection strategy may suffer bias or even fail in regions where the process knowledge is insufficient. To overcome this problem, this study demonstrates a holistic ESLM framework which consists of five components: model conceptualization, data compilation, process identification, parsimonious model calibration, and model validation. Based on the STEP-AWBH conceptual model, a comprehensive pool of 210 potential environmental variables that exhaustively cover pedogenic and environmental factors was constructed. This was followed by strategic variable selection and development of parsimonious prediction models using machine learning techniques. The all-relevant variable selection successfully identified the major and minor factors relevant to the SOC variation, showing that the major factors important for explaining SOC variation in Florida were vegetation and soil water gradient. Topography and climate showed moderate effects on SOC variation. Parsimonious SOC models developed using four minimal-optimal variable selection techniques and simulated annealing yielded optimal predictive performance with minimal model complexity. The holistic ESLM framework not only provides a new view of selecting and utilizing variables for predicting soil properties but can also assist in identifying the underlying processes of soil-environment systems of interest. Due to the flexibility of the framework to incorporate various types of variable selection and modeling techniques, the holistic environmental modeling strategy can be generalized to other environmental modeling domains for both prediction and process identification. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Yang2016,
abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration, and a better understanding of the spatial patterns of SOC is essential for soil resource management. In this study, we used boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) models to map the distribution of topsoil organic carbon content at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in China. A set of 105 soil samples and 12 environmental variables (including topography, climate and vegetation) were analyzed. The performance of the models was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Maps of the mean values and standard deviations of SOC were generated to illustrate model variability and uncertainty. The results indicate that the BRT and RF models exhibited very similar performance and yielded similar predicted distributions of SOC. The two models explained approximately 70{\%} of the total SOC variability. The BRT and RF models robustly predicted the SOC at low observed SOC values, whereas they underestimated high observed SOC values. This underestimation may have been caused by biased distributions of soil samples in the SOC space. Vegetation-related variables were assigned the highest importance in both models, followed by climate and topography. Both models produced spatial distribution maps of SOC that were closely related to vegetation cover. The SOC content predicted by the BRT model was clearly higher than that of the RF model in areas with greater vegetation cover because the contributions of vegetation-related variables in the two models (65{\%} and 43{\%}, respectively) differed significantly. The predicted SOC content increased from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the study area, average values produced by the BRT and RF models were 27.3 g kg-1 and 26.6 g kg-1, respectively. We conclude that the BRT and RF methods should be calibrated and compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC spatial distribution in similar regions. In addition, vegetation variables, including those obtained from remote sensing imagery, should be taken as the main environmental indicators and explicitly included when generating SOC maps in Alpine environments.},

abstract = {Existing predictive soil mapping (PSM) methods often require soil sample data to be sufficient to represent soil–environment relationships throughout the study area. However, in many parts of the world with only a limited quantity of soil sample data to represent the study area, this is still an issue for PSM application. This paper presents a method, named ‘individual predictive soil mapping' (iPSM), which can make use of limited soil sample data for PSM. With the assumption that similar environmental conditions have similar soils, iPSM uses the soil–environment relationship at each individual soil sample location to predict soil properties at unvisited locations and estimate prediction uncertainty. Specifically, the environmental similarities of an unvisited location to a set of soil sample locations are used in a weighted average method to integrate the soil–environment relationships at sample locations for prediction and uncertainty estimation. As a case study, iPSM was applied to map soil organic matter (SOM) content ({\%}) in the topsoil layer using two sets of soil samples. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), iPSM produced a more accurate SOM map (root mean squared error (RMSE) 1.43, mean absolute error (MAE) 1.16) than MLR (RMSE 8.54, MAE 7.34) the ability of the sample set to represent the study area is limited and achieved a comparable accuracy (RMSE 1.10, MAE 0.69) with MLR (RMSE 1.01, MAE 0.73) when the sample set could represent the study area better. In addition, the prediction uncertainty estimated by iPSM was positively related to prediction residuals in both scenarios. This study demonstrates that iPSM is an effective alternative when existing soil samples are limited in their ability to represent the study area and the prediction uncertainty in iPSM can be used as an indicator of its prediction accuracy.},

En Colombia, talleres similares se han realizado en varias oportunidades en el marco de un convenio de cooperaci{\'{o}}n entre el ITC y el Instituto Geogr{\'{a}}fico Agust{\'{i}}n Codazzi (IGAC). En el ITC, la materia de geopedolog{\'{i}}a, bajo la denominacion de Physiography and Soils, se dict{\'{o}} como parte de un curso de postgrado anual sobre levantamiento de suelos en el per{\'{i}}odo de 1986-2004. Despu{\'{e}}s de un largo per{\'{i}}odo de recesi{\'{o}}n y casi olvido, el tema del suelo como recurso de usos m{\'{u}}ltiples, base de soporte a diversas formas de vida, y prestador de servicios ambientales, ha vuelto, aunque t{\'{i}}midamente, a figurar en las agendas pol{\'{i}}ticas nacionales e internacionales. Esta es una de las razones que motivaron formalizar el presente texto. En un tiempo en que se pone {\'{e}}nfasis en el levantamiento digital de los suelos, la geopedolog{\'{i}}a propone un enfoque paisaj{\'{i}}stico integrando geoforma y suelo, el cual puede resultar ventajosamente complementario con el enfoque digital y contribuir a mejorar la base conceptual de este {\'{u}}ltimo. El presente texto es la primera parte de un conjunto que posteriormente propondr{\'{a}} una serie de estudios de caso, en los cuales se aplic{\'{o}} el enfoque geopedol{\'{o}}gico para levantamiento de suelos y an{\'{a}}lisis de riesgos naturales. Se agradecen comentarios y observaciones cr{\'{i}}ticas para mejorar esta primera versi{\'{o}}n (zincka@itc.nl). III},

@article{Cavazzi2013a,
abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are fundamental in assessing soil variability and are regularly used in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as a scale benchmark for all the other environmental covariates. They are conventionally used at their original grid resolution with a conventional 3??3 window size for the computation of the derived terrain attributes. The choice of scale frames the analysis and shapes the end result suggesting that better attention and quantitative knowledge of scale may improve predictive performance. Previous studies have shown the influence of pixel size but have not investigated in detail the interacting effect between window and pixel sizes. The aim of this study was to examine the scale dependency of soil classification performance at the landscape scale using two machine-learning techniques commonly applied in DSM: artificial neural networks and random forest. These were applied in three different areas in terms of their geomorphology and soil type located in Ireland. A series of DEMs representing different scales were created from the original 20m DEM by smoothing and re-sampling it with different window and pixel sizes for a total of 143 combinations: the original, 10 smoothed but not re-sampled, 12 re-sampled and not smoothed, and 120 smoothed and re-sampled. These were used to generate 11 terrain parameters from which 4 points per km2 were randomly extracted and used to predict soil classes. The overall prediction accuracy in the three study areas varied between 35{\%} and 60{\%}. Pixel size was found significant in all areas, the interaction between window and pixel sizes significant in morphologically rough areas and window size was significant only in flat homogeneous areas at coarser resolutions (above 140m in this study). In general, predictive performance was best at very fine and very coarse scales in morphologically varied areas, coarse scales in flat homogenous areas and relatively scale invariant in mixed areas. We conclude by examining whether this empirical approach is appropriate to compare scale combinations to obtain a better prediction accuracy of DSM techniques. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},
