abstract = {The accuracy of spatial predictions of rainfall by merging rain-gauge and radar data is partly determined by the sampling design of the rain-gauge network. Optimising the locations of the rain-gauges may increase the accuracy of the predictions. Existing spatial sampling design optimisation methods are based on minimisation of the spatially averaged prediction error variance under the assumption of intrinsic stationarity. Over the past years, substantial progress has been made to deal with non-stationary spatial processes in kriging. Various well-documented geostatistical models relax the assumption of stationarity in the mean, while recent studies show the importance of considering non-stationarity in the variance for environmental processes occurring in complex landscapes. We optimised the sampling locations of rain-gauges using an extension of the Kriging with External Drift (KED) model for prediction of rainfall fields. The model incorporates both non-stationarity in the mean and in the variance, which are modelled as functions of external covariates such as radar imagery, distance to radar station and radar beam blockage. Spatial predictions are made repeatedly over time, each time recalibrating the model. The space-time averaged KED variance was minimised by Spatial Simulated Annealing (SSA). The methodology was tested using a case study predicting daily rainfall in the north of England for a one-year period. Results show that (i) the proposed non-stationary variance model outperforms the stationary variance model, and (ii) a small but significant decrease of the rainfall prediction error variance is obtained with the optimised rain-gauge network. In particular, it pays off to place rain-gauges at locations where the radar imagery is inaccurate, while keeping the distribution over the study area sufficiently uniform.},

abstract = {Both for mapping and for estimating spatial means of an environmental variable, the accuracy of the result will usually be increased by dispersing the sample locations so that they cover the study area as uniformly as possible. We developed a new R package for designing spatial coverage samples for mapping, and for random sampling from compact geographical strata for estimating spatial means. The mean squared shortest distance (MSSD) was chosen as objective function, which can be minimized by k-means clustering. Two k-means algorithms are described, one for unequal area and one for equal area partitioning. The R package is illustrated with three examples: (1) subsampling of square and circular sampling plots commonly used in surveys of soil, vegetation, forest, etc.; (2) sampling of agricultural fields for soil testing; and (3) infill sampling of climate stations for mainland Australia and Tasmania. The algorithms give satisfactory results within reasonable computing time. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We compared the suitability of several commonly applied digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to quantify uncertainty with regards to a survey of soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) in Hungary. To represent the wide range of DSM techniques fairly, the followings were selected: universal kriging (UK), sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS), random forest combined with kriging (RFK) and quantile regression forest (QRF). For RFK two different uncertainty quantification approaches were adopted based on kriging variance (RFK-1) and bootstrapping (RFK-2). The selection of the potential environmental covariates was based on Jenny's factorial model of soil formation. The spatial predictions of SOCS and their uncertainty models were evaluated and compared using a control dataset. For this purpose, we applied the most common measures (i.e. mean error and root mean square error), furthermore, accuracy plot and G statistic. According to our results, QRF and SGS produced the best uncertainty models. UK and RFK-2 overestimated the uncertainty whereas RFK-1 produced the worst uncertainty quantification according to the accuracy plots and G statistics. We could draw the general conclusion that there is a need to validate the uncertainty models. Furthermore, great attention should be paid to the assumptions made in uncertainty modelling.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The central importance of soil for the functioning of terrestrial systems is increasingly recognized. Critically relevant for water quality, climate control, nutrient cycling and biodiversity, soil provides more functions than just the basis for agricultural production. Nowadays, soil is increasingly under pressure as a limited resource for the production of food, energy and raw materials. This has led to an increasing demand for concepts assessing soil functions so that they can be adequately considered in decision-making aimed at sustainable soil management. The various soil science disciplines have progressively developed highly sophisticated methods to explore the multitude of physical, chemical and biological processes in soil. It is not obvious, however, how the steadily improving insight into soil processes may contribute to the evaluation of soil functions. Here, we present to a new systemic modeling framework that allows for a consistent coupling between reductionist yet observable indicators for soil functions with detailed process understanding. It is based on the mechanistic relationships between soil functional attributes, each explained by a network of interacting processes as derived from scientific evidence. The non-linear character of these interactions produces stability and resilience of soil with respect to functional characteristics. We anticipate that this new conceptional framework will integrate the various soil science disciplines and help identify important future research questions at the interface between disciplines. It allows the overwhelming complexity of soil systems to be adequately coped with and paves the way for steadily improving our capability to assess soil functions based on scientific understanding.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper reviews the application of ecological vulnerability analysis in risk assessment and describes new developments in methodology. For generic non-site-specific assessments (e.g. for the requirements of most European directives on dangerous chemicals) risk is characterised just on the basis of the ratio between an effect indicator and an exposure indicator. However, when the actual risk for a specific ecosystem is desired, the concept of ecological vulnerability may be more appropriate. This calls for a change in thinking, from sensitivity at the organism level to vulnerability at higher organization levels, and thus forms the link from laboratory toxicology to field effects at population, community or ecosystem level. To do so, biological and ecological characteristics of the ecosystems under concern are needed to estimate the ecological vulnerability.In this review we describe different vulnerability analysis methods developed for populations (of a single species), communities (consisting of different populations of species) and ecosystems (community and habitat combined). We also give some examples of methods developed for socio-ecological systems. Aspects that all methods share are the use of expert judgment, the input of stakeholders, ranking and mapping of the results, and the qualitative nature of the results.A new general framework is presented to guide future ecological vulnerability analysis. This framework can be used as part of ecological risk assessment, but also in risk management. We conclude that the further quantification of ecological vulnerability is a valuable contribution to vulnerability assessment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in controlling the function and quality of soil and offsetting the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, the dynamic monitoring and estimation of SOC are very difficult due to the complex traditional methods and the changing environmental variables. For instance, the calculation of SOC stock requires measurement of a few relevant soil attributes, such as soil organic matter (SOM), soil bulk density (SBD), soil moisture, and soil weight, in the laboratory. Many studies have suggested that visible and near-infrared (vis–NIR) spectra are a practical and affordable alternative to accurately and rapidly estimate the soil attributes relevant to SOC stock, and airborne hyperspectral images can be used as a valuable data source to perform digital soil mapping with high spatial resolution. The objective of this research was to check the predicted capability of SOC stock through laboratory and airborne vis–NIR spectral data. A total of 50 topsoil samples (0–15 cm) from the farmland of Iowa City were used as the study object. The partial least squares regression model was used to predict SOC stock through the direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, the SOC stock was predicted using the spectral data. In the indirect method, the relevant soil properties (SOM and SBD) of the SOC stock were predicted using the spectral data, and then the SOC stock was calculated. The mechanism of the prediction methods and the potential influencing factors of the model performance were discussed from the aspect of electromagnetic theory and empirical statistics. Results showed the following: (i) SOC stock can be successfully predicted using the laboratory spectra and the airborne hyperspectral image through the direct and indirect methods; (ii) the SOC stock and its relevant soil properties (SOM and SBD) showed evident spectral absorption characteristics in the vis–NIR spectral band; (iii) the atmospheric environment and soil surface conditions were the main influencing factors of the prediction accuracy between the airborne and laboratory spectra. This research might be useful for the dynamic monitoring and modeling of SOC in agricultural and environmental fields.},

abstract = {The soil organic matter (SOM) content is strongly related to soil fertility and greenhouse gas emissions. Knowledge of the soil SOM content is therefore necessary for efficient and sustainable management practices. In this study, we compare the performance of five machine learning techniques for the prediction of SOM contents using remote sensing, proximal soil sensors and topographic data as environmental predictor. The methods used were kriging, Cubist, Random Forest and regression-kriging (Cubist- kriging and Random Forest kriging). 285 soil samples were collected from a 10 ha field in Denmark. 75{\%} of the data were used for training and 25{\%} for validation. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), DVI (Difference Vegetation Index) and SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) were derived from Sentinel 2 images with 10 m resolution as auxiliary variables. Topographic variables were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) with 1.6 m resolution. The performance of the methods was compared based on the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that kriging achieved the best performance, followed by regression-kriging. The models using only Cubist and Random forest had the poorest performance. The results, therefore, demonstrate that kriging can predict SOM contents without the need of auxiliary variables for fields with high sampling densities.},

abstract = {It is impossible to make pedological maps without understanding subsurface attributes. Several strategies can be used for soil mapping, from a tacit knowledge to mathematical modeling. However, there are still gaps in knowledge regarding how to optimize subsurface mapping. This work aimed to quantify subsurface soil attributes using satellite spectral reflectance and geographically weighted regression (GWR) techniques. The study was carried out in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil, in an area spanning 47,882 ha. Multitemporal satellite images (Landsat-5) were initially processed in order to retrieve spectral reflectance from the bare soil surface. Based on a toposequence method, 328 points were then distributed across the area (at depths between 0 and 20 cm and 80 and 100 cm) and analyzed for their soil chemical and physical attributes (including the reflectance spectra (400 to 2500 nm)) in the laboratory. We achieved 67.72{\%} of bare soil for the whole study area, with the remaining 32.28{\%} of the unmapped surface being filled by kriging interpolation. All 328 samples were modeled using surface (Landsat-5 TM spectral reflectance) and subsurface (acquired in the laboratory) data, reaching up to 0.72 R 2adj . The correlation between the spectra of both depths was significant and the soil attributes prediction reached an R 2adj of validation above 0.6 for clay, hue, value, and chroma at 0–20 and 80–100 cm depths. The satellite soil surface reflectance allowed the estimation of soil subsurface attributes. These results demonstrate that diagnostic soil attributes can be quantified based on spectral pedotransfer (SPEDO) functions to assist digital soil mapping and soil monitoring. Despite our efforts to determine soil subsurface properties using digital soil mapping approach, this task still need considerable refinement. Thus, research must continue to aggregate outcomes from other techniques.},

abstract = {Conventional soil maps contain valuable knowledge on soil–environment relationships. Such knowledge can be extracted for use when updating conventional soil maps with improved environmental data. Existing methods take all polygons of the same map unit on a map as a whole to extract the soil–environment relationship. Such approach ignores the difference in the environmental conditions represented by individual soil polygons of the same map unit. This paper proposes a method of mining soil–environment relationships from individual soil polygons to update conventional soil maps. The proposed method consists of three major steps. Firstly, the soil–environment relationships represented by each individual polygon on a conventional soil map are extracted in the form of frequency distribution curves for the involved environmental covariates. Secondly, for each environmental covariate, these frequency distribution curves from individual polygons of the same soil map unit are synthesized to form the overall soil–environment relationship for that soil map unit across the mapped area. And lastly, the extracted soil–environment relationships are applied to updating the conventional soil map with new, improved environmental data by adopting a soil land inference model (SoLIM) framework. This study applied the proposed method to updating a conventional soil map of the Raffelson watershed in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, United States. The result from the proposed method was compared with that from the previous method of taking all polygons within the same soil map unit on a map as a whole. Evaluation results with independent soil samples showed that the proposed method exhibited better performance and produced higher accuracy.},

abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a highly heterogeneous biome of global ecological significance with high levels of terrestrial carbon stocks and aboveground biomass (AGB). Accurate maps of AGB are required for monitoring, reporting, and modelling of forest resources and carbon stocks. Previous research has linked plot-level AGB with environmental and remotely sensed data using pixel-based approaches. However, few studies focused on investigating possible improvements via object-based image analysis (OBIA) including terrain related data to predict AGB in topographically variable and mountainous regions, such as Atlantic forest in Minas Gerais, Brazil. OBIA is expected to reduce known uncertainties related to the positional discrepancy between the image and field data and forest heterogeneity, while terrain derivatives are strong predictors in forest ecosystems driving forest biomass variability. In this research, we compare an object-based approach to a pixel-based method for modeling, mapping and quantifying AGB in the Rio Doce basin, within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. We trained a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm using environmental, terrain, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) remotely sensed imagery. We aimed to: (i) increase the precision of the AGB estimates; (ii) identify optimal variables that fit the best model, with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE, Mg/ha); (iii) produce an accurate map of the AGB for the study area, and subsequently (iv) describing the AGB spatial distribution as a function of the selected variables. The RF object-based model notably improved the AGB prediction by reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) from 28.64 to 20.95{\%}, and RMSE from 33.43 to 20.08 Mg/ha, and increasing the R² (from 0.57 to 0.86) by using a combination of selected remote sensing, environmental, and terrain variables. Object-based modelling is a promising alternative to common pixel-based approaches to reduce AGB variability in topographically diverse and heterogeneous environments. Investigation of mapped outcomes revealed a decreasing AGB from west towards the east region of the Rio Doce Basin. Over the entire study area, we map a total of 195,799,533 Mg of AGB, ranging from 25.52 to 238 Mg/ha, following seasonal precipitation patterns and anthropogenic disturbance effects. This study provided reliable AGB estimates for the Rio Doce basin, one of the most important watercourses of the globally important Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In conclusion, we highlight that OBIA is a better solution to map forest AGB than the pixel-based traditional method, increasing the precision of AGB estimates in a heterogeneous and mountain tropical environment.},

abstract = {In recent years, the environmental modeling community has moved away from kriging as the main mapping algorithm and embraced machine learning (ML) as the go-to method for spatial prediction. The drawback of this shift has been a gradual decline in the number of papers in which uncertainty is presented and mapped alongside estimates of the target variables because in some ML algorithms, computing the local uncertainty can be challenging. This drawback has been recently identified in the literature as one of the key areas in DSM where progress is most needed. The main objective of this work is to compare geostatistical techniques, ML methods and hybrid methods, e.g., regression kriging, in terms of not only their overall accuracy but also their precision in providing useful confidence intervals at unsampled locations. We aim to provide clear application guidelines for future mapping exercises. For this experiment, we used a legacy soil dataset (n = 414) of topsoil observations from the semi-arid Mediterranean region of Sicily. This dataset was collected in a 2008 survey with a pedo-landscape sampling design; hence, it is ideal for comparing geostatistics and ML. In the comparison, we included algorithms that have been widely adopted in the literature: ordinary and universal kriging, linear regression, random forest (RF), quantile regression forest, boosted regression trees (BRT) and hybrid forms of kriging (e.g., regression kriging with RF and BRT used as regressors). To evaluate the accuracy of each algorithm, a validation test that was based on the random exclusion of 25{\%} of the samples was repeated 100 times. In addition, we performed a test of the transferability, in which the locations with the largest nearest-neighbor distances were excluded from training and re-predicted. The validation results demonstrate that ordinary and universal kriging are the best performers, followed closely by random forest (RF) and quantile regression forest (QRF). In terms of local uncertainty, RF and QRF provide confidence intervals that most often include the observed values of SOC. However, they both provide very wide confidence intervals, which may be problematic in some studies. Other algorithms, such as boosted regression trees and boosted regression kriging, performed slightly worse (on this dataset), but produced narrower ranges of uncertainty. Hence, they may be more attractive since their estimates are very robust against changes and noise in the predictors.},

abstract = {Analysing spatial patterns of soil properties in a landscape requires a sampling strategy that adequately covers soil toposequences. In this context, we developed a hybrid methodology that couples global weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) and cost-constrained conditioned Latin hypercube algorithm (cLHC). This methodology produce an optimized sampling stratification by analysing the local variability of the soil property, and the influence of environmental factors. The methodology captures the maximum local variances in the global auxiliary dataset with the GWPCA, and optimizes the selection of representative sampling locations for sampling with the cLHC. The methodology also suppresses the subsampling of auxiliary datasets from areas that are less representative of the soil property of interest. Consequently, the method stratifies the geographical space of interest in order to adequately represent the soil property. We present results on the tested method (R 2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.18 m) from the Guinea savannah zone of Ghana. • It defines the local structure and accounts for localized spatial autocorrelation in explaining variability. • It suppresses the occurrence of model-selected sampling locations in areas that are less representative of the soil property of interest.},

abstract = {Knowledge about distribution of soil properties over the landscape is required for a variety of land management applications and resources, modeling, and monitoring practices. The main aim of this research was to conduct a spatially prediction of the top soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and clay content using digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches in Borujen region, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari province, central Iran. To achieve this goal, a total of 334 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth. Three non-linear models including Cubist (Cu), Random Forest (RF), Regression Tree (RT) and a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to link environmental covariates and the studied soil properties. The environmental covariates were obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imagery (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper; ETM). The model was calibrated and validated by the 10-fold cross-validation approach. Root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) were used to determine the performance of the models, and relative RMSE (RMSE{\%}) was used to define prediction accuracy. According to the RMSE and R 2 , Cu and RF resulted in the most accurate predictions for CCE (R 2 = 0.30 and RMSE = 9.52) and clay contents (R 2 = 0.15 and RMSE = 7.86), respectively, while both of RF and Cu models showed the highest performance to predict SOC content (R 2 = 0.55). Results showed that remote sensing covariates (Ratio Vegetation Index and band 4) were the most important variables to explain the variability of SOC and CCE content, but only topographic attributes were responsible for clay content variation. According to RMSE{\%} results, it could be concluded that the best model is not necessarily able to make the most accurate estimation. This study recommended that more observations and denser sampling should be carried out in the entire study area. Alternatively, stratified sampling by elevation in homogeneous sub-areas was recommended. The stratified sampling probably will increase the performance of models.},

This measurement error affects subsequent modelling and therefore must be integrated when calibrating a spatial prediction model. This paper introduces a deep learning model for contextual Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) using uncertain measurements of the soil property. The deep learning model, called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has the advantage that it uses as input a local representation of environmental covariates to leverage the spatial information contained in the vicinity of a location. Spatial non-linear relationships between covariate pixel values and measured soil properties are found by optimizing an objective function, which can be weighted with respect to a measurement error of soil observations. In addition, a single model can be trained to predict a soil property at different soil depths. This method is tested in mapping top- and subsoil organic carbon using laboratory analyzed and spectroscopically inferred measurements. Results show that CNNs significantly increased prediction accuracy as indicated by the coefficient of determination and concordance correlation coefficient, when compared to a conventional DSM technique. Deeper soil layer prediction error decreased, while preserving the interrelation between soil property and depths. The tests conducted using different window size of input covariates matrix to predict organic carbon suggest that CNN benefits from using local contextual information up to 260 to 360{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}metres.

abstract = {Delimitation of soil types within a farm field is key for site-specific crop management. An alternative to this, is to develop pedometric techniques that allow an efficient combination of soil survey information and high-resolution terrain attribute data. The aim of this study was to present and evaluate a pedometric technique to delimit soil-specific zones at field scale by coupled Random forest, fuzzy k-means clustering and spatial principal components algorithms (RF-KM-sPCA) and by using information from soil surveys and terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model. The protocol involves three-steps: 1) automatic classification of small (20x20m) spatial units (SU) using the knowledge of the soil map units present in the farm landscape, 2) aggregation of SUM at farm scale and 3) validation of soil-specific zones. For the first step, we used the random forest algorithm with 10 terrain attributes. For the second step, KM-sPCA algorithms were used to cluster within field SU accounting for autocorrelation. For the third step, apparent soil electrical conductivity and yield maps was used to validate the delimitation of soil-specific zones. This technique produced more contiguous zones than other cluster methods which do not use spatiality. Six farm fields with highly differences in soils were partitioned by the proposed pedometric strategy. Apparent soil electrical conductivity and yield maps present significant differences among zones in all experimental fields. This analytic strategy, based in easy-to-obtain data, could be used to improve precision agricultural managements.},

abstract = {Carbon stored in soils contributes to a variety of soil functions, including biomass production, water storage and filtering, biodiversity maintenance, and many other ecosystem services. Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC) spatial distribution and projection of its future condition is essential for future CO 2 emission estimates and management options for storing carbon. However, modeling SOC spatiotemporal dynamics is challenging due to the inherent spatial heterogeneity and data limitation. The present study developed a spatially explicit prediction model in which the spatial relationship between SOC observation and seventeen environmental variables was established using the Cubist regression tree algorithm. The model was used to compile a baseline SOC stock map for the top 30 cm soil depth in the State of Wisconsin (WI) at a 90 m × 90 m grid resolution. Temporal SOC trend was assessed by comparing baseline and future SOC stock maps based on the space-for-time substitution model. SOC prediction for future considers land use, precipitation and temperature for the year 2050 at medium (A1B) CO 2 emissions scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Field soil observations were related to factors that are known to influence SOC distribution using the digital soil mapping framework. The model was validated on 25{\%} test profiles (R 2 : 0.38; RMSE: 0.64; ME: −0.03) that were not used during model training that used the remaining 75{\%} of the data (R 2 : 0.76; RMSE: 0.40; ME: −0.006). In addition, maps of the model error, and areal extent of Cubist prediction rules were reported. The model identified soil parent material and land use as key drivers of SOC distribution including temperature and precipitation. Among the terrain attributes, elevation, mass-balance index, mid-slope position, slope-length factor and wind effect were important. Results showed that Wisconsin soils had an average baseline SOC stock of 90 Mg ha −1 and the distribution was highly variable (CV: 64{\%}). It was estimated that WI soils would have an additional 20 Mg ha −1 SOC by the year 2050 under changing land use and climate. Histosols and Spodosols were expected to lose 19 Mg ha −1 and 4 Mg ha −1 , respectively, while Mollisols were expected to accumulate the largest SOC stock (62 Mg ha −1 ). All land-use types would be accumulating SOC by 2050 except for wetlands (−34 Mg C ha −1 ). This study found that Wisconsin soils will continue to sequester more carbon in the coming decades and most of the Driftless Area will be sequestering the greatest SOC (+63 Mg C ha −1 ). Most of the SOC would be lost from the Northern Lakes and Forests ecological zone (−12 Mg C ha −1 ). The study highlighted areas of potential C sequestration and areas under threat of C loss. The maps generated in this study would be highly useful in farm management and environmental policy decisions at different spatial levels in Wisconsin.},

abstract = {Particle-size distribution (PSD) plays an important role in influencing a number of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Currently, digital soil mapping (DSM) methods based on empirical observations have been widely used in mapping PSD. However, DSM methods rarely consider soil genetic processes. This paper investigated the use of a mechanistic soil evolution model, State Space Soil Production and Assessment Model (SSSPAM), to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of PSD in the Hunter Valley, NSW, Australia. SSSPAM simulates the spatial and temporal variation of PSD within a landscape based on erosion due to overland flow, deposition, and physical weathering within the soil profile. We conducted a simulation over the 144 km 2 area using a 30 m digital elevation model (DEM) as an input. The model simulated soil evolution over 70,000 years to ensure that the PSD had reached steady-state. To validate and analyze the influence of different process parameters on particle size dynamics, we carried out a parametric study in a field within the study area and found a strong relationship between runoff excess generation, exponential weathering rate, and soil particle-size distribution. As expected, higher discharge rates produced coarser particles and larger weathering rates produced finer PSD. We further explored the feasibility of combining the mechanistic SSSPAM and empirical DSM approaches by comparing simulation results with observed sand content. We found limitations of the SSSPAM model to predict sand fraction accurately in the study area due to incomplete process coverage. The output of SSSPAM can be improved by integrating it with DSM techniques. Overall, SSSPAM can explore how particle size will change through time and identify areas with risks of erosion and deposition. Such a model can be used to inform large-scale management to ensure our soil is secured in the future.},

abstract = {To understand if soil carbon acts as a sink or source in the global carbon cycle it is not only important to make reliable estimates, but also determine upper and lower prediction bounds through uncertainty analysis that represent best and worst case conditions. In this study, the Bayesian geostatistics was applied to assess the uncertainty associated with the predictive models of SOC (top soils) in a large region - Florida, USA. Results showed that the Bayesian estimates of model parameters were comparable to the conventional geostatistical methods especially the restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The Bayesian prediction uncertainty assessment was encouragingly accurate based on the validation of 50 and 95{\%} prediction intervals with the validation dataset. Generally, the width of prediction intervals increased with the posterior mean SOC predictions - large prediction intervals were found in the Everglades Agricultural Area (Histosols) and the wetland areas in the Suwannee River Basin. The Bayesian constant mean model (high model inadequacy) had marked prediction uncertainty which was reduced by accounting for the effects of environmental covariates in the Bayesian linear trend model (low model inadequacy), indicating that model inadequacy had a negative impact on prediction uncertainty. Analyses of factors impacting SOC prediction uncertainty suggest that effects that explained more of the SOC variance contributed more uncertainty to the SOC prediction. These findings are critical to quantify SOC stocks in the southeastern USA where a heterogeneous mosaic of high and low carbon in soils occurs ranging from 0.45 to 34.15 kg m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Although this study considers only the topsoil, the results are valuable for global carbon cycling research. The uncertainty of SOC predictions not only enables identification of "hot" and "cold" spots in a landscape to mitigate and adapt to global climate change, but also informs scenario assessment to imagine possible carbon- rich, -neutral, and -poor futures.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}ABSTRACT Digital elevation models (DEM) used in digital soil mapping (DSM) are commonly selected based on measures and indicators (quality criteria) that are thought to reflect how well a given DEM represents the terrain surface. The hypothesis is that the more accurate a DEM, the more accurate will be the DSM predictions. The objective of this study was to assess different criteria to identify the DEM that delivers the most accurate DSM predictions. A set of 10 criteria were used to evaluate the quality of nine DEMs constructed with different data sources, processing routines and three resolutions (5, 20, and 30 m). Multinomial logistic regression models were calibrated using 157 soil observations and terrain attributes derived from each DEM. Soil class predictions were validated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results showed that, for each resolution, the quality criteria are useful to identify the DEM that more accurately represents the terrain surface. However, for all three resolutions, the most accurate DEM did not produce the most accurate DSM predictions. With the 20-m resolution DEMs, DSM predictions were five percentage points less accurate when using the more accurate DEM. The 5-m resolution was the most accurate DEM overall and resulted in DSM predictions with 44{\%} accuracy; this value was equal to that obtained with two coarser resolution, lower accuracy DEMs. Thus, identifying the truly best DEM for DSM requires assessment of the accuracy of DSM predictions using some form of external validation, because not necessarily the most accurate DEM will produce the best DSM predictions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Analysis revealed that by combining information from multiple near infrared, and short wave infrared channels, NMDI has enhanced the sensitivity to drought severity, and is well suited to estimate both soil and vegetation moisture. Typical soil reflectance spectra and satellite-acquired reflectances, are used to validate the usefulness of NMDI.

abstract = {The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was developed as a standard satellite vegetation product for the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS). EVI provides improved sensitivity in high biomass regions while minimizing soil and atmosphere influences, however, is limited to sensor systems designed with a blue band, in addition to the red and near-infrared bands, making it difficult to generate long-term EVI time series as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) counterpart. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a 2-band EVI (EVI2), without a blue band, which has the best similarity with the 3-band EVI, particularly when atmospheric effects are insignificant and data quality is good. A linearity-adjustment factor $\beta$ is proposed and coupled with the soil-adjustment factor L used in the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) to develop EVI2. A global land cover dataset of Terra MODIS data extracted over land community validation and FLUXNET test sites is used to develop the optimal parameter (L, $\beta$ and G) values in EVI2 equation and achieve the best similarity between EVI and EVI2. The similarity between the two indices is evaluated and demonstrated with temporal profiles of vegetation dynamics at local and global scales. Our results demonstrate that the differences between EVI and EVI2 are insignificant (within ± 0.02) over a very large sample of snow/ice-free land cover types, phenologies, and scales when atmospheric influences are insignificant, enabling EVI2 as an acceptable and accurate substitute of EVI. EVI2 can be used for sensors without a blue band, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and may reveal different vegetation dynamics in comparison with the current AVHRR NDVI dataset. However, cross-sensor continuity relationships for EVI2 remain to be studied. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index) and soil moisture improves our understanding of how these indices respond to soil moisture fluctuations. Soil moisture deficits are ultimately tied to drought stress on plants. The diverse terrain and climate of Oklahoma, the extensive soil moisture network of the Oklahoma Mesonet, and satellite-derived indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provided an opportunity to study correlations between soil moisture and vegetation indices over the 2002-2006 growing seasons. Results showed that the correlation between both indices and the fractional water index (FWI) was highly dependent on land cover heterogeneity and soil type. Sites surrounded by relatively homogeneous vegetation cover with silt loam soils had the highest correlation between the FWI and both vegetation-related indices (r similar to 0.73), while sites with heterogeneous vegetation cover and loam soils had the lowest correlation (r similar to 0.22).

abstract = {The norn{\~{}}alized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around O. 66 I{\~{}}m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 I{\~{}}m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (p(0.86 IJm)-p(1.24 ltm))/ (p(0.86 I{\~{}}m) + p(1.24 I{\~{}}m)), where p represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-1{\~{}}m and the 1.24-ltm channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 I{\~{}}m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 I{\~{}}m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 I{\~{}}m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI, NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-ltm channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 I{\~{}}m, ND WI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (A VIRIS) over Jas-per Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given. {\textcopyright} Elsevier Science Inc., 1996 INTRODUCTION The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the most widely used index for remote sensing of vegetation in the past two decades. It is equal to (/{\~{}}IR-pnED) / (pMR + P{\~{}}D), where PREP is the radiance (in reflectance units) of a red channel near 0.66 /{\~{}}m, and pNln the radiance (in reflectance units) of a near-IR channel around 0.86 /lm. This index has been used in many applications, including estimation of crop yields and end-of-season above-ground dry biomass (Tucker et al., 1986). The two channels used in NDVI sense through different depths of vegetation canopies. The near-IR channel can see roughly eight leaf layers, while the red channel sees only one leaf layer or less (Lillesaeter, 1982) because of the strong chlorophyll absorption near 0.67 ktm. In spite of its usefulness, NDVI is known to be saturated when applied to images over areas having leaf area index of 3 or greater. Numerous other vegetation indices with varying complexity have been developed using the same set of near-IR and red channels during the past decade. These indices do not have nearly the same popularity as that of NDVI. The recently developed Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) (Kaufman and Tanr6, 1992) used not only the near-IR and red channels, but also a blue channel near 0.47 pm. This index has self-correction properties for the atmospheric effect. Remote sensing of vegetation liquid water has important applications in agriculture and forestry. In this article, a normalized difference water index (NDWI) that uses two near-IR channels centered approximately at 0.86 lxm and 1.24 ttm for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space is proposed. The 1.24-ttm channel has not been used previously in the formation of vegetation indices. Preliminary research on this index was reported in a scientific conference (Gao, 1995). BACKGROUND},

Three different sampling devices were applied in an agricultural area using the same sampling protocol. Cr, Sc and Zn mass fractions in the collected soil samples were measured by k0-instrumental neutron activation analysis (k0-INAA). For each element-device combination the experimental variograms were calculated using geostatistical tools. The variogram parameters were used to estimate the standard uncertainty arising from sampling. The sampling component represents the dominant contribution of the measurement uncertainty with a sampling uncertainty to measurement uncertainty ratio ranging between 0.6 and 0.9. The approach based on the use of variogram parameters leads to uncertainty values of the sampling component in agreement with those estimated by replicate sampling approach. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Digital information generates the possibility of a high degree of redundancy in the data available for fitting predictive models used for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM). Among these models, the Decision Tree (DT) technique has been increasingly applied due to its capacity of dealing with large datasets. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the data volume used to generate the DT models on the quality of soil maps. An area of 889.33 km² was chosen in the Northern region of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The soil-landscape relationship was obtained from reambulation of the studied area and the alignment of the units in the 1:50,000 scale topographic mapping. Six predictive covariates linked to the factors soil formation, relief and organisms, together with data sets of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 {\%} of the total data volume, were used to generate the predictive DT models in the data mining program Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). In this study, sample densities below 5 {\%} resulted in models with lower power of capturing the complexity of the spatial distribution of the soil in the study area. The relation between the data volume to be handled and the predictive capacity of the models was best for samples between 5 and 15 {\%}. For the models based on these sample densities, the collected field data indicated an accuracy of predictive mapping close to 70 {\%}.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the spatial distribution of soil carbon (C) pools across diverse land uses, soils, and climatic gradients at regional scale is still limited. Research in digital soil mapping and modeling that investigates the interplay between (i) soil C pools and environmental factors (“deterministic trend model”) and (ii) stochastic, spatially dependent variations in soil C fractions (“stochastic model”) is just emerging. This evoked our motivation to investigate soil C pools in the State of Florida covering about 150,000 km2. Our specific objectives were to (i) compare different soil C pool models that quantify stochastic and/or deterministic components, (ii) assess the prediction performance of soil C models, and (iii) identify environmental factors that impart most control on labile and recalcitrant pools and soil total C (TC). We used soil data (0–20 cm) from a research collected at 1014 georeferenced sites including measured bulk density, recalcitrant carbon (RC), labile (hot-water extractable) carbon (HC) and TC. A comprehensive set of 327 geospatial soil-environmental variables was acquired. The Boruta method was employed to identify “all-relevant” soil-environmental predictors. We employed eight methods - Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), Bagged Regression Tree (BaRT), Boosted Regression Tree (BoRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Regression Kriging (RK), and Ordinary Kriging (OK) – to predict soil C fractions and TC. Overall, 36, 20 and 25 predictors stood out as “all-relevant” to estimate TC, RC and HC, respectively. We predicted a mean of 5.29 ± 3.58 kg TC m−2 in the top 20 cm with the best model. The prediction performance assessed by the Ratio of Prediction Error to Inter-quartile Range for TC stocks was as follows: RF {\textgreater} SVM {\textgreater} BoRT {\textgreater} BaRT {\textgreater} PLSR {\textgreater} RK {\textgreater} CART {\textgreater} OK. The best models explained 71.6{\%}, 71.7{\%} and 30.5{\%} of the total variation for TC, RC and HC, respectively. Biotic and hydro-pedological factors explained most of the variation in soil C pools and TC; lithologic and climatic factors showed some relationships to soil C pools and TC, whereas topographic factors faded from soil C models.},

Despite the evidence regarding the importance of soil for provision of local and global ecosystem services, such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, soil remains an under‐investigated and undermined aspect of the environment. Here we evaluate to what extent soil indicators are taken into account in restoration. We focused on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly fragmented biome and a global biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a systematic literature review and we show that the majority (59{\%}) of the studies on restoration did not consider any soil indicator. Studies that demonstrate soil indicators, most commonly reported soil pH (71 {\%}, n = 44), followed by potassium content (66{\%}, n = 41) and phosphorus (64.5{\%}, n = 40), while least reported indicator was water retention (6.5{\%}, n = 4). Only 40{\%} of the retrieved studies included information about reference sites or project baseline information. We complement our literature review with a case study on restoration in two areas of Atlantic Forest. We found a relation between soil indicators such as soil organic matter, nitrogen, sodium and sand content and above‐ground indicators, confirming a necessity to include soil screening in restoration. Moreover, we found that prior to restoration none of these soil indicators were analysed. This study highlights the gap that exists in soil data in restoration in studies on Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We urge scientists and practitioners to include basic soil analysis to maximise the successful outcomes of restoration. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Currently the land use and land use change (LULUC) emits 1.3 ± 0.5 Pg carbon (C) year−1, equivalent to 8{\%} of the global annual emissions. The objectives of this study were to quantify (1) the impact of LULUC on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a subtropical region and (2) the role of conservation agriculture to mitigate GHG emissions promoting ecosystem services. We developed a detailed IPCC Tier 2 GHG inventory for the Campos Gerais region of southern Brazil that has large cropland area under long-term conservation agriculture with high crop yields. The inventory accounted for historical and current emissions from fossil fuel combustion, LULUC and other minor sources. We used Century model to simulate the adoption of conservation best management practices, to all croplands in the region from 2017 to 2117. Our results showed historical (1930–2017) GHG emissions of 412 Tg C, in which LULUC contributes 91{\%} (376 ± 130 Tg C), the uncertainties ranged between 13 and 36{\%}. Between 1930 and 1985 LULUC was a major source of GHG emission, however from 1985 to 2015 fossil fuel combustion became the primary source of GHG emission. Forestry sequestered 52 ± 24 Tg C in 0.6 Mha in a period of 47 years (1.8 Tg C Mha−1 year−1) and no-till sequestered 30.4 ± 24 Tg C in 2 Mha in a period of 32 years (0.5 Tg C Mha−1 year−1) being the principal GHG mitigating activities in the study area. The model predictions showed that best management practices have the potential to mitigate 13 years of regional emissions (330 Tg C in 100 years) or 105 years of agriculture, forestry and livestock emissions (40 Tg C in 100 years) making the agriculture sector a net carbon (C) sink and promoting ecosystem services.},

@article{Ramsey1997,
abstract = {Methods have been devised for estimating measurement uncertainties due to field sampling. These methods have revealed very large discrepancies between the estimated levels of lead in one area of contaminated land. The uncertainty estimate for the estimated lead concentration at one sampling site, when sampled by one sampler (an individual collecting the samples) using one protocol, was very large (50{\%}, for 95{\%} confidence). The uncertainty on the estimated mean concentration was also large (55{\%}) for nine different organisations using the same sampling protocol. These organisations were participating in the sampling trials by sending samplers to the sampling targets. This uncertainty was due entirely to the sampling, rather than the analytical measurement as all the analyses were carried out in random sequence within one batch. When sampling organisations used whatever sampling protocol that they considered appropriate, and analysed their own samples, the uncertainty on the mean concentration was 45.5{\%}. The similarities in these estimates suggest that heterogeneity is a limiting factor in measurement uncertainty at this site. The existing criteria for the classification of contaminated land generally depend on a deterministic comparison between measured concentration of a contaminate and a threshold level. With such large values of measurement uncertainty in the estimated concentration of the contaminant due to field sampling, it is likely that land will be misclassified. This has legal, financial and possible health implications from both the unnecessary remediation of 'uncontaminated' land and regarding land as uncontaminated that is in fact contaminated. A new probabilistic classification scheme for contaminated land is proposed that allows for the overall measurement uncertainty as well as the estimated concentration of the contaminant. A term 'possibly contaminated' is given to locations where the measured concentration is below a threshold, but the uncertainty interval exceeds the threshold. The acceptable probability of misclassification can be selected to reflect the risks at that particular site.},

abstract = {Mapping high resolution (30-m or better) cropland extent over very large areas such as continents or large countries or regions accurately, precisely, repeatedly, and rapidly is of great importance for addressing the global food and water security challenges. Such cropland extent products capture individual farm fields, small or large, and are crucial for developing accurate higher-level cropland products such as cropping intensities, crop types, crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), crop productivity, and crop water productivity. It also brings many challenges that include handling massively large data volumes, computing power, and collecting resource intensive reference training and validation data over complex geographic and political boundaries. Thereby, this study developed a precise and accurate Landsat 30-m derived cropland extent product for two very important, distinct, diverse, and large countries: Australia and China. The study used of eight bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR1, and NDVI) of Landsat-8 every 16-day Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for the years 2013–2015. The classification was performed by using a pixel-based supervised random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm (MLA) executed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Each band was time-composited over 4–6 time-periods over a year using median value for various agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Australia and China. This resulted in a 32–48-layer mega-file data-cube (MFDC) for each of the AEZs. Reference training and validation data were gathered from: (a) field visits, (b) sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) data, and (c) ancillary sources such as from the National agriculture bureaus. Croplands versus non-croplands knowledge base for training the RF algorithm were derived from MFDC using 958 reference-training samples for Australia and 2130 reference-training samples for China. The resulting 30-m cropland extent product was assessed for accuracies using independent validation samples: 900 for Australia and 1972 for China. The 30-m cropland extent product of Australia showed an overall accuracy of 97.6{\%} with a producer's accuracy of 98.8{\%} (errors of omissions = 1.2{\%}), and user's accuracy of 79{\%} (errors of commissions = 21{\%}) for the cropland class. For China, overall accuracies were 94{\%} with a producer's accuracy of 80{\%} (errors of omissions = 20{\%}), and user's accuracy of 84.2{\%} (errors of commissions = 15.8{\%}) for cropland class. Total cropland areas of Australia were estimated as 35.1 million hectares and 165.2 million hectares for China. These estimates were higher by 8.6{\%} for Australia and 3.9{\%} for China when compared with the traditionally derived national statistics. The cropland extent product further demonstrated the ability to estimate sub-national cropland areas accurately by providing an R2value of 0.85 when compared with province-wise cropland areas of China. The study provides a paradigm-shift on how cropland maps are produced using multi-date remote sensing.

In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

abstract = {The automation of agricultural mapping using satellite-derived remotely sensed data remains a challenge in Africa because of the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, and limited access to local knowledge. Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or at most a one-time effort at mapping the continent at coarse resolution remote sensing. In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated cropland mapping algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge on the croplands of Africa available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (sub-meter to five-meter) resolution imagery (VHRI), and (c) local knowledge captured during field visits and/or sourced from country reports and literature. The study used 16-day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited data at 250-m resolution for the entire African continent. Based on these data, the study first produced accurate reference cropland layers or RCLs (cropland extent/areas, irrigation versus rainfed, cropping intensities, crop dominance, and croplands versus cropland fallows) for the year 2014 that provided an overall accuracy of around 90{\%} for crop extent in different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The RCLs for the year 2014 (RCL2014) were then used in the development of the ACMA algorithm to create ACMA-derived cropland layers for 2014 (ACL2014). ACL2014 when compared pixel-by-pixel with the RCL2014 had an overall similarity greater than 95{\%}. Based on the ACL2014, the African continent had 296 Mha of net cropland areas (260 Mha cultivated plus 36 Mha fallows) and 330 Mha of gross cropland areas. Of the 260 Mha of net cropland areas cultivated during 2014, 90.6{\%} (236 Mha) was rainfed and just 9.4{\%} (24 Mha) was irrigated. Africa has about 15{\%} of the world's population, but only about 6{\%} of world's irrigation. Net cropland area distribution was 95 Mha during season 1, 117 Mha during season 2, and 84 Mha continuous. About 58{\%} of the rainfed and 39{\%} of the irrigated were single crops (net cropland area without cropland fallows) cropped during either season 1 (January-May) or season 2 (June-September). The ACMA algorithm was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and applied on MODIS time-series data from 2003 through 2014 to obtain ACMA-derived cropland layers for these years (ACL2003 to ACL2014). The results indicated that over these twelve years, on average: (a) croplands increased by 1 Mha/yr, and (b) cropland fallows decreased by 1 Mha/year. Cropland areas computed from ACL2014 for the 55 African countries were largely underestimated when compared with an independent source of census-based cropland data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5 Mha. ACMA demonstrated the ability to hind-cast (past years), now-cast (present year), and forecast (future years) cropland products using MODIS 250-m time-series data rapidly, but currently, insufficient reference data exist to rigorously report trends from these results.},

abstract = {Many applied problems arising in agricultural monitoring and food security require reliable crop maps at national or global scale. Large scale crop mapping requires processing and management of large amount of heterogeneous satellite imagery acquired by various sensors that consequently leads to a “Big Data” problem. The main objective of this study is to explore efficiency of using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform when classifying multi-temporal satellite imagery with potential to apply the platform for a larger scale (e.g. country level) and multiple sensors (e.g. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). In particular, multiple state-of-the-art classifiers available in the GEE platform are compared to produce a high resolution (30 m) crop classification map for a large territory ({\~{}}28,100 km2 and 1.0 M ha of cropland). Though this study does not involve large volumes of data, it does address efficiency of the GEE platform to effectively execute complex workflows of satellite data processing required with large scale applications such as crop mapping. The study discusses strengths and weaknesses of classifiers, assesses accuracies that can be achieved with different classifiers for the Ukrainian landscape, and compares them to the benchmark classifier using a neural network approach that was developed in our previous studies. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv region (North of Ukraine) in 2013. We found that Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides very good performance in terms of enabling access to the remote sensing products through the cloud platform and providing pre-processing; however, in terms of classification accuracy, the neural network based approach outperformed support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and random forest classifiers available in GEE.},

We thus introduce a new tool, GE Grids, to bridge this gap. This tool creates an interactive user-specified binary grid laid over Google Earth's high-resolution imagery. Using GE Grids, we manually identified anthropogenic land conversion across East Africa and compared this against available land cover datasets. Nearly 30{\%} of East Africa is converted to anthropogenic land cover. The two highest-resolution comparative datasets have the greatest agreement with our own at the regional extent, despite having as low as 44{\%} agreement at the country level. We achieved 83{\%} consistency among users. GE Grids is intended to complement existing remote sensing datasets at local scales.},

abstract = {Land cover in Beijing experienced a dramatic change due to intensive human activities, such as urbanization and afforestation. However, the spatial patterns of the dynamics are still unknown. The archived Landsat images provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect land cover changes over the past three decades. In this study, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trajectory to detect major land cover dynamics in Beijing. Then, we classified the land cover types in 2015 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud calculation. By overlaying the latest land cover types and the spatial distribution of land cover dynamics, we determined the main types where a land cover change occurred. The overall change detection accuracy for three types (vegetation loss associated with negative change in NDVI, vegetation gain associated with positive change in NDVI, and no changes) is 86.13{\%}. We found that the GEE is a fast and powerful tool for land cover mapping, and we obtained a classification map with an overall accuracy of 86.61{\%}. Over the past 30 years, 1402.28 km2of land was with vegetation loss and 1090.38 km2of land was revegetated in Beijing. The spatial pattern of vegetation loss and vegetation gain shows significant differences in different zones from the center of the city. We also found that 1162.71 km2of land was converted to urban and built-up, whereas 918.36 km2of land was revegetated to cropland, shrub land, forest, and grassland. Moreover, 202.67 km2and 156.75 km2of the land was transformed to forest and shrub land in the plain of Beijing that were traditionally used for cropland and housing.},

abstract = {Land-use/land-cover information is the basis of global-change research and regional governmental management. Automatic approaches are always required to update land maps for large-scale areas, and change detection techniques are the most important component of land-updating methods. Previous research has confirmed that simple change detection based on Landsat images from two different years with two different phenophases yields unsatisfactory results and may induce many misclassifications and pseudo-change identifications because of the phenological differences between remote sensing images. With the support of the Google Earth Engine (GEE), we propose a land-use/land-cover type discrimination method based on a classification and regression tree (CART), apply change-vector analysis in posterior probability space (CVAPS) and the best histogram maximum entropy method for change detection, and further improve the accuracy of the land-updating results in combination with NDVI timing analysis, which indicates the annual growth of ground vegetation. In the case study, we select western China as the research area and obtain a 2014 land map based on the ESA GlobCover 2009 dataset. The results confirm that the accuracy of the land-renewal results based on the CART-CVAPS-NDVI method reach 78.6–88.2{\%}, which is 4–10{\%} higher than that of the CART-CVPAS method without NDVI timing analysis. The CART-CVAPS-NDVI method has more detailed and accurate resolutions for land-change detection.},

We use the Weka and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African example demonstrates that DDM (64–91{\%} accuracy) can identify the areas where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy as conventional modelling techniques (54–77{\%} accuracy). The Sicilian example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for potentially contentious decisions. We conclude that DDM has a clear role to play when modelling ecosystem services, helping produce interdisciplinary models and holistic solutions to complex socio-ecological issues.},

Soil Sci. 48, 19-30] a method for mapping soil properties with acceptable precision and cost was proposed. It combined soil classification and interpolation by kriging, and used sample information from a reference area and simple soil observations over the mapping region. In this paper a new version of the method was developed in which soil patterns are modelled by a conditional probability approach and are used to improve interpolation. The mapping method consists of three stages. First is the classification of a set of sites covering the region according to the soil classification of the reference area. Second is the determination over the reference area of the probability of occurrence of soil classes at a site from the knowledge of the relief and of the soil classes at neighbouring sites. Third is the prediction of the soil properties at unvisited sites by a weighted average of the values of the soil properties at the representative profiles of the soil classes, with the weights being taken proportional to the conditional probability of occurrence of each soil class. The performance of the procedure was evaluated for mapping water content at wilting point in an area of 1736 ha in a physiographic region of Southern France. The method was compared with its previous version, namely classification with kriging, and with ordinary kriging and prediction from a soil map at a scale of 1:100000. It was clearly more precise than the predictions from the 1:100000 soil map and close to that of ordinary kriging with measured data. It performed similarly to classification with kriging when prediction points were close to observation points, but provided better results than classification with the kriging when prediction points were far from the observation points. This latter result illustrates the benefits of modelling soil patterns as related to topographical features for interpolation purposes. (C) Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon, the major component of soil organic matter, is very important in all soil processes. The decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) is recognized as one of the eight soil threats identified in the European Union Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (COM (2006)231 final) (EC, 2006). The research challenge in this paper is to develop aggregation techniques which can ‘catch' the variability at local level and being able to transfer this knowledge to larger scales. The latest developments included the research in upscaling modelling techniques which allow transferring the data values from local to regional scale. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) and in particular regression kriging has been selected as the most appropriate modelling approach for the study. It has been successfully implemented at regional level and a soil organic carbon map was produced for the selected region (Slavkovsky Forest, 2400 km2, Czech Republic) by transferring knowledge from Lysina Critical Zone Observatory (0.40 km2). The Lysina CZO is situated in western Bohemia, the Czech Republic. Using digital soil mapping (DSM), demonstrated that it is possible to upscale the processes that take place at Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) towards larger regions. According to the prediction results, the soil organic carbon values in the Slavkovsky Forest are ranging between 0{\%} - 35.11{\%}. The results of the linear regression procedure is promising, however, the statistical indicators are relatively low (R2=0.31) in the first step of the two stage model. The results of the study encourage applying similar approach at a wider scale. However, the ground data availability is still the key component to have more robust geostatistical models. The model and its outputs can be improved by using more ground data and high resolution environmental covariates.},

The aim of this work is to examine two global soil moisture datasets and a set of soil moisture web-based processing tools developed to demonstrate the value of the soil moisture data for drought monitoring and crop forecasting using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The two global soil moisture datasets discussed in the paper are generated by integrating the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions' satellite-derived observations into a modified two-layer Palmer model using a one-dimensional (1D) ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation approach. The web-based tools are designed to explore soil moisture variability as a function of land cover change and to easily estimate drought characteristics such as drought duration and intensity using soil moisture anomalies and to intercompare them against alternative drought indicators. To demonstrate the utility of these tools for agricultural drought monitoring, the soil moisture products and vegetation- and precipitation-based products were assessed over drought-prone regions in South Africa and Ethiopia. Overall, the 3-month scale Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed higher agreement with the root zone soil moisture anomalies. Soil moisture anomalies exhibited lower drought duration, but higher intensity compared with SPIs. Inclusion of the global soil moisture data into the GEE data catalog and the development of the web-based tools described in the paper enable a vast diversity of users to quickly and easily assess the impact of drought and improve planning related to drought risk assessment and early warning. The GEE also improves the accessibility and usability of the earth observation data and related tools by making them available to a wide range of researchers and the public. In particular, the cloud-based nature of the GEE is useful for providing access to the soil moisture data and scripts to users in developing countries that lack adequate observational soil moisture data or the necessary computational resources required to develop them.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Remote sensing is an important tool for studying the effects of deforestation, land use change as well as climate change on forest stands worldwide. As carbon sinks, forests are of very high importance for the global carbon cycle. In this study, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) in conjunction with Landsat 5 and 8 images was used to study the development of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time in three study areas across Germany. The study areas are located in the Biosphere Reserve Schw{\"{a}}bische Alb, National Park Hainich and Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin and are part of the Biodiversity Exploratories network. Temporal patterns in the NDVI data from 1984-2013 showed that while NDVI was increasing at all sites from 1984-1990, NDVI was strongly declining in recent years (2013-2016). This decline in NDVI is linked to land use change and its negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function as well as ecosystem services. Temporal patterns show much variation between deciduous and coniferous trees as well as between study areas. Study area Biosphere Reserve SchorfheideChorin showed the most stable NDVI development in recent years while NDVI at the other two sites declined more steeply, pointing toward a healthier forest at Biosphere Reserve SchorfheideChorin. Remote sensing of forest stands will likely play an even more important role with advancing climate change. Scripts developed in this thesis can be reused and adapted for other study areas worldwide.},

abstract = {Abstract Light soils occupy 8{\%} of the Brazilian territory and are especially expressive in the new and last agricultural frontier in Brazil: the Matopiba region - in the states of Maranh{\~{a}}o, Tocantins, Piau{\'{i}}, and Bahia -, where they represent 20{\%} of the area. These soils fit into the textural classes of sand and loamy sand or sandy loam, down to 0.75-m soil depth or deeper, and they are mainly represented by Neossolos Quartzar{\^{e}}nicos (Quartzipsamments) and, partly, by Latossolos (Oxisols) and Argissolos (Ultisols). The understanding of soil functioning depends on the establishment of distinguishing criteria for: organic matter dynamics; content and mineralogy of the clay fraction; coarse sand and total sand contents, in relation to those of fine sand; mean diameter of the sand fraction; and water retention capacity. These criteria can contribute for the zoning and for the conservation and fertility management of light soils, as well as for the estimation of their agricultural potential. Integrated production systems, such as crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forestry integration, besides no-tillage with crop rotation, mixed forestry planting with legumes, and the use of green manure and cover crops are relevant for the proper management of these soils. The objective of this review was to characterize light soils and to highlight the main challenges regarding their agricultural potential and their conservation and fertility managements, in face of the expansion and consolidation of the new Brazilian agricultural frontier.},

The study area was the Lajeado River Watershed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We used forty predictor covariables, derived from a digital elevation model with 30 m resolution, in which the three selection models were applied and separated into subsets. These subsets were used to assess performance by applying four prediction algorithms. The wrapper method obtained the best performance values for the predictive model in all the algorithms evaluated. The three selection methods applied reduced the number of covariables in the predictive models by 70 {\%} and enabled prediction of the 14 soil mapping units.},

Established towards the end of 2010, it provides access to satellite and other ancillary data, cloud computing, and algorithms for processing large amounts of data with relative ease. However, the uptake and usage of the opportunity remains varied and unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the usage patterns of the Google Earth Engine platform and whether researchers in developing countries were making use of the opportunity. Analysis of published literature showed that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals. The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical fields such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the first to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations. There were very few studies originating from institutions based in less developed nations and those that targeted less developed nations, particularly in the African continent.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is done in this paper by computing at each site of the large region a mathematical distance between local soilscapes and those in the reference area. Soilscapes are represented by a cover frequency vector of elementary landscape classes (combinations of soil-forming factor classes) calculated within an area defined around the site under consideration. The application of this technique to four reference areas located in the H{\'{e}}rault-Libron-Orb valleys in the south of France demonstrated that: (1) the proposed soilscape distance was in good agreement with the degree of representativity of a reference area (i.e. percentage of soil classes already encountered in the reference area), (2) representative areas of different size and purity can be delineated from a soilscape distance map by applying a distance threshold, (3) expertise in delineating a reference area has a strong influence on its performances, i.e. size vs. purity of representative area. This suggests that the soilscape distance tested in this paper could be integrated in a classification procedure defining the optimal size and location of future reference areas. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Measures for the accuracy assessment of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are discussed and characteristics of DEMs derived from laser scanning and automated photogrammetry are presented. Such DEMs are very dense and relatively accurate in open terrain. Built-up and wooded areas, however, need automated filtering and classification in order to generate terrain (bare earth) data when Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) have to be produced. Automated processing of the raw data is not always successful. Systematic errors and many outliers at both methods (laser scanning and digital photogrammetry) may therefore be present in the data sets. We discuss requirements for the reference data with respect to accuracy and propose robust statistical methods as accuracy measures. Their use is illustrated by application at four practical examples. It is concluded that measures such as median, normalized median absolute deviation, and sample quantiles should be used in the accuracy assessment of such DEMs. Furthermore, the question is discussed how large a sample size is needed in order to obtain sufficiently precise estimates of the new accuracy measures and relevant formulae are presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

A TLS point cloud often has a very fine spatial resolution, which can represent well the spatial variation of a terrain surface. However, the uncertainty in DEMs created from this relatively new type of source data is not well understood, which forms the focus of this letter. TLS survey data representing four terrain surfaces of different characteristics were used to explore the effects of surface complexity and typical TLS data density (in terms of data point spacing) on DEM accuracy. The spatial variation in TLS data can be decomposed into parts corresponding to the signal of spatial variation (of terrain surfaces) and noise due to measurement error. We found a linear relation between the DEM error and the typical TLS data spacings considered (30-100 mm) which arises as a function of the interpolation error, and a constant contribution from the propagated data noise. This letter quantifies these components for each of the four surfaces considered and shows that, for the interpolation method considered here, higher density sampling would not be beneficial.},

abstract = {Much of the carbon (C) stored in the soil of the high Qinghai–Tibet Plateau could be lost as a result of global warming. To provide a baseline against which to assess the loss we have made a new map at 90-m resolution from sample data of 1148 soil profiles augmented by information on climate, vegetation, physiography and digital elevation. We used the program Cubist, which works as a form of regression tree, to predict the concentration at the nodes of the 90-m grid. The uncertainty of the predictions was computed by bootstrapping 50 times at each node. Soil type, evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation, radiation and vegetation type contributed most to the variation in C at the coarse scale; temperature, net primary productivity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ET and elevation contributed most at finer scales. We mapped the predicted concentration of C and converted the predictions to stocks of C for the main kinds of land: 1.93 Pg for the alpine steppe, 1.57 Pg for the meadow, 0.66 Pg in the coniferous forest, 0.63 Pg in the broadleaf forest, 1.06 Pg under shrub, {\textless} 0.4 Pg for each of the alpine desert and cropland. We estimate the uppermost 30 cm of soil to contain 6.81 Pg of C with 95{\%} (3.80 to 10.27 Pg). This estimate differs substantially from the two previous coarser estimates based on global modelling which far exceed our 95{\%} upper confidence limit. Our new estimate can now serve as a base against which to judge any change of soil C as a response to global warming.},

Given that the state of the environment and food security are strongly interlinked in tropical landscapes, the increasing need for land for food production, urbanization and other uses poses several threats to sustainability in the long term. This paper demonstrates the integration of land and soil health maps with socioeconomic datasets into an online, open-access platform called the Resilience Diagnostic and Decision Support Tool for Turkana County in Kenya, using the Stakeholder Approach to Risk Informed and Evidence Based Decision Making (SHARED) methodology. The paper highlights the utility of spatial assessments of soil organic carbon (SOC) for monitoring land degradation neutrality (LDN) compliance, understanding the drivers of SOC dynamics and inclusion of these in stakeholder decision-making. The main objectives of this paper were to (1) demonstrate the application of a systematic approach for land health assessments, including spatial mapping of soil organic carbon; (2) show an operational interdisciplinary framework for assessing ecosystem health and (3) showcase the application of evidence-based tools for stakeholder engagement using the SHARED approach. Through the approaches and tools presented, the paper addresses the increasing need for more integrated approaches when assessing and managing ecosystem health to meet the targets of the 2030 Agenda, including Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3. In addition to systematic and reliable biophysical and socioeconomic assessments, stakeholder engagement with evidence is crucial to support such integrated approaches.},

To represent the wide range of DSM techniques fairly, the followings were selected: universal kriging (UK), sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS), random forest combined with kriging (RFK) and quantile regression forest (QRF). For RFK two different uncertainty quantification approaches were adopted based on kriging variance (RFK-1) and bootstrapping (RFK-2). The selection of the potential environmental covariates was based on Jenny's factorial model of soil formation. The spatial predictions of SOCS and their uncertainty models were evaluated and compared using a control dataset. For this purpose, we applied the most common measures (i.e. mean error and root mean square error), furthermore, accuracy plot and G statistic. According to our results, QRF and SGS produced the best uncertainty models. UK and RFK-2 overestimated the uncertainty whereas RFK-1 produced the worst uncertainty quantification according to the accuracy plots and G statistics. We could draw the general conclusion that there is a need to validate the uncertainty models. Furthermore, great attention should be paid to the assumptions made in uncertainty modelling.},

abstract = {Land use change strongly affects soil organic carbon (SOC), which is a critical driving force for soil quality and soil services. However, the influence of detailed land use dynamics on SOC remains an active research field. We investigated the impact of long-term grass-/cropland conversion dynamics on SOC for the Swiss agroecosystem (8‵500 km2). In Switzerland multi-temporal SOC observations are sparse, while the spatio-temporal resolution of available land use data is inadequate to capture small structured and dynamic land use. Thus, we stratified one-time SOC observations of two periods (n1995–1999= 1096; n2011–2015= 502) into typical land use classes of grass-/cropland conversion regimes to analyze states and trends of SOC. First, based on spectral imagery and auxiliary variables, we established a Random Forest classifier to detect annual grass-/cropland distributions in a spatial resolution of 30 × 30 m for 2000–2015. Second, we used the annual land use maps to derive classes of typical land use dynamics based on a pattern description of conversion regimes. Third, we comparatively assessed the SOC covariate importance (IMP) and SOC sample representation of land use dynamics using terrain and climate covariates. Subsequently, we statistically analyzed SOC across land use dynamics and two periods. The land use classifier shows an Overall Accuracy of 86{\%}, while the annual land use maps deviate by 6{\%}–11{\%} from census data. 46{\%} of the farmland underlies frequent grass-/cropland conversions. The SOC covariate importance of land use dynamics is increased by at least 2.4 times compared to the SOC covariates. The SOC observations consistently represent land use dynamics across SOC covariates. In both periods, SOC increased as the grassland share within the land use regimes increased. The mean SOC for permanent grasslands is 35 g kg−1and 17 g kg−1for permanent croplands. Areas of land use conversions where grassland is dominant show increased SOC (29–30 g kg−1) compared to areas where cropland was dominant (23–25 g kg−1). The mean differences of SOC between the periods and classes are statistically not significant except for permanent cropland, for which the SOC is decreased by 5.2 g kg−1.},

Security is used here for soil in the same sense that it is used widely for food and water. It is argued that soil has an integral part to play in the global environmental sustainability challenges of food security, water security, energy sustainability, climate stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem service delivery. Indeed, soil has the same existential status as these issues and should be recognized and highlighted similarly. The concept of soil security is multi-dimensional. It acknowledges the five dimensions of (1) capability, (2) condition, (3) capital, (4) connectivity and (5) codification, of soil entities which encompass the social, economic and biophysical sciences and recognize policy and legal frameworks. The soil security concept is compared with the cognate, but more limited, notions of soil quality, health and protection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Hillslope elements have considerable potential in predicting soil properties and types in the landscape, making them likely to be a useful basis for detailed soil mapping. The goal of this research was to apply a previously developed digital hillslope position (DHP) model, calibrate it as needed to a Brazilian landscape, and test its utility as a basis for identification of detailed soil map units. The study area covers 2500 ha and is located on the border between the municipalities of Piracicaba and Santa B{\'{a}}rbara d'Oeste, S{\~{a}}o Paulo state, Brazil. A digital elevation model, with spatial resolution of 5 m, was used to obtain slope gradient, profile curvature and relative elevation with different analysis scales. Hierarchical rules for these digital terrain derivatives were used to segment the landscape into hillslope positions. The user-calibrated hillslope position model was verified against local experience by identifying the hillslope position in the field and comparing it with the model classification using the Kappa statistic and a confusion matrix. Soil samples were collected across multiple hillslopes with different lithologies. The samples were analyzed for chemical composition and soil particle size separates. The measured soil properties were assessed for statistical significance by variance analysis among hillslope position, parent material, and the interaction between the two. Student's t-tests were performed iteratively across each hillslope position within a given parent material to identify specifically which soil properties were significantly different among the hillslope position map units. Variance analysis of soil samples located within the respective parent material map units identified significant differences for all soil properties measured, but only for some soil properties when categorized by DHP. Focusing on the parent material with a sufficient quantity of samples, there was always at least one hillslope position that was significantly different from the others for each soil property. Because each of these map units presented a significant difference in at least one soil property, they are useful for detailed soil mapping.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important soil property relating to soil formation, structure, and water-holding capacity. Remote sensing has been used for predicting SOC but remains a challenge due to the complex and indirect relationship between SOC and remote sensing variables. In this research we explored the approaches of predicting SOC distribution in a hickory plantation region using random forest (RF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) based on Landsat and ancillary data, analyzed SOC spatial distribution and dynamic change between 2008 and 2013 through a thresholding approach, and examined major factors that resulted in SOC degradation in the young and mature hickory plantations using a logistic regression. The results showed that RF outperformed GWR in the prediction of SOC and provided stable and reliable SOC predictions with root mean squared errors of 4.6 g kg−1in 2008 and 4.4 g kg−1in 2013. A large area of hickory plantation was experiencing SOC decrease. The analysis of major factors causing SOC degradation indicated that steep slope and high proportion of silt component in soil resulted in SOC decrease in the young hickory plantations, and high elevation, high proportion of silt component in the soil, and the increase of soil fraction in the ground cover led to SOC decrease in the mature hickory plantations. This research provides valuable approaches to spatially predict SOC and identify major factors driving SOC degradation, which will be useful for adopting better measures to improve management of hickory plantations.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {Accurate digital soil maps of soil organic matter (SOM) are needed to evaluate soil fertility, to estimate stocks, and for ecological and environment modeling. We used 5982 soil profiles collected during the second national soil survey of China, along with 19 environment predictors, to derive a spatial model of SOM concentration in the topsoil (0–20 cm layer). The environmental predictors relate to the soil forming factors, climate, vegetation, relief and parent material. We developed the model using the Cubist machine-learning algorithm combined with a non-parametric bootstrap to derive estimates of model uncertainty. We optimized the Cubist model using a 10-fold cross-validation and the best model used 17 rules. The correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values was 0.65, and the root mean squared error was 0.28 g/kg. We then applied the model over China and mapped the SOM distribution at a resolution of 90 × 90 m. Our predictions show that there is more SOM in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, northern Heilongjiang province, northeast Mongolia, and a small area of Tianshan Mountain in Xinjiang. There is less SOM in the Loess Plateau and most of the desert areas in northwest China. The average topsoil SOM content is 24.82 g/kg. The study provides a map that can be used for decision-making and contribute towards a baseline assessment for inventory and monitoring. The map could also aid the design of future soil surveys and help with the development of a SOM monitoring network in China.},

abstract = {There are increasing demands nowadays on spatial soil information in order to support environmental related and land use management decisions. Physical soil properties, especially particle size distribution play important role in this context. A few of the requirements can be satisfied by the sand-, silt-, and clay content maps compiled according to global standards such as GlobalSoilMap (GSM) or Soil Grids. Soil texture classes (e. g. according to USDA classification) can be derived from these three fraction data, in this way texture map can be compiled based on the proper separate maps.Soil texture class as well as fraction information represent direct input of crop-, meteorological- and hydrological models. The model inputs frequently require maps representing topsoil features, which refer most commonly to 0-30 cm depth. This is covered by three consecutive depth intervals according to standard specifications: 0-5 cm, 5-15 cm, 15-30 cm. Becoming GSM and SoilGrids the most detailed freely available spatial soil data sources, the common model users (e. g. meteorologists, agronomists, or hydrologists) would produce input map from (the thickness-weighted mean of) these three layers. However, if the basic soil data and proper knowledge is obtainable, a soil texture map targeting directly the 0-30 cm layer could be independently compiled.In our work we compared Hungary's soil texture maps compiled using the same reference and auxiliary data and inference methods but for differing layer distribution. We produced the 0-30 cm clay, silt and sand map as well as the maps for the three standard layers (0-5 cm, 5-15 cm, 15-30 cm). Maps of sand-, silt-, and clay content were computed through composite regression kriging applying Additive Log-Ratio (alr) transformation. In addition to the Hungarian Soil Information and Monitoring System as reference soil data, digital elevation model and its derived components, soil physical property maps, remotely sensed images, land use-, geological-, as well as meteorological data were applied as auxiliary variables.We compared the directly compiled and the synthetized clay-, sand content, and texture class maps by different tools. In addition to pairwise comparison of basic statistical features (histograms, scatter plots), we examined the spatial distribution of the differences. We quantified the taxonomical distances of the textural classes, in order to investigate the differences of the map-pairs.We concluded that the directly computed and the synthetized maps show various differences. In the case of clay-, and sand content maps, the map-pairs have to be considered statistically different. On the other hand, the differences of the texture class maps are not significant. However, in all cases, the differences rather concern the extreme ranges and categories. Using of synthetized maps can intensify extremities by error propagation in models and scenarios. Based on our results, we suggest the usage of the directly composed maps.},

abstract = {There are a dearth of studies globally examining soil organic carbon (SOC) at large catchment scales. Here we assess the catchment scale climate and geomorphic controls on SOC. The study was conducted on the east coast of New South Wales, Australia and focussed on a 562 km2(Krui River) catchment sampled in 2006 and 2015 and a 606 km2(Merriwa River) catchment sampled in 2015. Both catchments have similar soils, topography and landuse. There was no significant difference in SOC between 2006 and 2014 data sets, indicating that SOC was temporally stable over the intervening 8 years (Krui catchment), despite the seasonal variability in climate such as rainfall. SOC concentration was also shown to have no significant difference between Krui catchment and Merriwa catchment, indicating that SOC is spatially stable for catchments of similar land-use, climate and geomorphology. SOC concentrations from all three data sets were compared to a range of terrain attributes. Similar with other studies, elevation, as a surrogate for orographic rainfall, was found to have the strongest significant control on SOC {\%} at the large catchment scale. Confirmation of the use of elevation as a surrogate for rainfall was made by comparing SOC with rainfall obtained from a network of weather stations across the study sites. Relationships between SOC and other terrain attributes found inconsistent relationships. The findings demonstrate that for catchments with similar soils, topography and climate that SOC can be reliably predicted using simple topographic variables. The methods here provide a robust tool which can be used for SOC assessment at other sites as well as assist in understanding SOC distribution and controls for longer term and regional scales.},

abstract = {Tanzania is one of the countries that has embarked on a national programme under the United Nations collaborative initiative on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD). Tanzania is currently developing the capacity to enter into a carbon monitoring REDD+ regime. In this context spatially representative soil carbon datasets and accurate predictive maps are important for determining the soil organic carbon pool. The main objective of this study was to model and map the SOC stock for the 0–30-cm soil layer to provide baseline information for REDD+ purposes. Topsoil data of over 1400 locations spread throughout Tanzania from the National Forest Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA), were used, supplemented by two legacy datasets, to calibrate simple kriging with varying local means models. Maps of SOC concentrations (g kg−1) were generated for the 0–10-cm, 10–20-cm, 20–30-cm, 0–30-cm layers, and maps of bulk density and SOC stock (kg m−2) for the 0–30-cm layer. Two approaches for modelling SOC stocks were considered here: the calculate-then-model (CTM) approach and the model-then-calculate approach (MTC). The spatial predictions were validated by means of 10-fold cross-validation. Uncertainty associated to the estimated SOC stocks was quantified through conditional Gaussian simulation. Estimates of SOC stocks for the main land cover classes are provided. Environmental covariates related to soil and terrain proved to be the strongest predictors for all properties modelled. The mean predicted SOC stock for the 0–30-cm layer was 4.1 kg m−2(CTM approach) translating to a total national stock of 3.6 Pg. The MTC approach gave similar results. The largest stocks are found in forest and grassland ecosystems, while woodlands and bushlands contain two thirds of the total SOC stock. The root mean squared error for the 0–30-cm layer was 1.8 kg m−2, and the R2-value was 0.51. The R2-value of SOC concentration for the 0–30-cm layer was 0.60 and that of bulk density 0.56. The R2-values of the predicted SOC concentrations for the 10-cm layers vary between 0.46 and 0.54. The 95{\%} confidence interval of the predicted average SOC stock is 4.01–4.15 kg m−2, and that of the national total SOC stock 3.54–3.65 Pg. Uncertainty associated with SOC concentration had the largest contribution to SOC stock uncertainty. These findings have relevance for the ongoing REDD+ readiness process in Tanzania by supplementing the previous knowledge of significant carbon pools. The soil organic carbon pool makes up a relatively large proportion of carbon in Tanzania and is therefore an important carbon pool to consider alongside the ones related to the woody biomass. Going forward, the soil organic carbon data can potentially be used in the determination of reference emission levels and the future monitoring, reporting and verification of organic carbon pools.},

abstract = {The Netherlands has a long history of soil research. Over the past 150. years, seven national soil maps have been produced at scales ranging from 1:50,000 to 1:1,000,000. The maps were based on different conceptual models which reflected advances in soil science as well as societal demands. There are four phases in the development of soil mapping in The Netherlands. The first three are: (i) the geological phase (1837-1937), (ii) the physiographic phase (1937-1962) and (iii) the morphometric phase (1962-1995). The earliest soil maps, made in the mid-1800s, were largely based on surface geology. In 1950 the first national soil map was published based on physiographic soil mapping. From the 1960s onwards, mapping followed a pedogenetic-morphometric approach and these maps have been widely used in land use planning, hydrologic studies, re-allotments, and agricultural land evaluations. An increase in environmental awareness with the need to assess environmental impacts and developments in information technology induced the digital soil information phase (1995-present). New technologies have improved the collection, storage, analysis and presentation of soil geographic information. It is concluded that initial soil mapping in The Netherlands had a strong agricultural focus but that the current maps are used in a wide range of applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

abstract = {* The ecological health of rivers worldwide continues to decline despite increasing effort and investment in river science and management. Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are increasingly being used as a mechanism for decision-making in river management because they provide a simple visual framework to explore different management scenarios for the multiple stressors that impact rivers. However, most applications of BBN modelling to resource management use expert knowledge and/or limited real data, and fail to accurately assess the ability of the model to make predictions. * We developed a BBN to model ecological condition in a New Zealand river using field/GIS data (from multiple rivers), rather than expert opinion, and assessed its predictive ability on an independent data set. The developed BBN performed moderately better than a number of other modelling techniques (e.g. artificial neural networks, classification trees, random forest, logistic regression), although model construction was more time consuming. Thus, the predictive ability of BBNs is (in this case at least) on a par with other modelling methods but the approach is distinctly better for its ability to visually present the data linkages, issues and potential outcomes of management options in real time. * The BBN suggested management of habitat quality, such as riparian planting, along with the current management focus on limiting nutrient leaching from agricultural land may be most effective in improving ecological condition. * BBNs can be a powerful and accurate method of effectively portraying the multiple interacting drivers of environmental condition in an easily understood manner. However, most BBN applications fail to appropriately test the model fit prior to use. We believe this lack of testing may seriously undermine their long-term effectiveness in resource management and recommend that BBNs should be used in conjunction with some measure of uncertainty about model predictions. We have demonstrated this for a BBN of ecological condition in a New Zealand river, shown that model fit is better than that for other modelling techniques, and that improving habitat would be equally effective to reducing nutrients to improve ecological condition.},

As a consequence, multiple soil maps are sometimes available for a particular area. Rather than selecting the best map, model ensemble offers a way to capitalize on existing soil information, and to improve the map accuracy. In this study we ensemble four topsoil texture maps of France with different resolution made by different organizations at the national, European, and global scale. We investigated two methods of model ensemble: the Granger-Ramanathan (GR) and Variance-Weighted (VW) methods. Ensemble methods based on area stratification were also tested to take into account local soil information. We also assessed the impact of the number of calibration points on the evaluation indicators. Both ensemble methods improved the accuracy of the map compared to the best of the primary maps, while the GR method outperformed the VW method. We found that the different stratification strategies did not improve the accuracy significantly when compared to the global methods. Finally, we showed that a relatively low number of calibration points is required in the merging process if the sampling is well designed. This study demonstrates that digital soil mapping products at various scales from various data sources can be combined with the ensemble method taking advantage of all existing efforts and taking care of harmonization issues.},

abstract = {Random forest is a classification technique widely used in remote sensing. One of its advantages is that it produces an estimation of classification accuracy based on the so called out-of-bag cross-validation method. It is usually assumed that such estimation is not biased and may be used instead of validation based on an external data-set or a cross-validation external to the algorithm. In this paper we show that this is not necessarily the case when classifying remote sensing imagery using training areas with several pixels or objects. According to our results, out-of-bag cross-validation clearly overestimates accuracy, both overall and per class. The reason is that, in a training patch, pixels or objects are not independent (from a statistical point of view) of each other; however, they are split by bootstrapping into in-bag and out-of-bag as if they were really independent. We believe that putting whole patch, rather than pixels/objects, in one or the other set would produce a less biased out-of-bag cross-validation. To deal with the problem, we propose a modification of the random forest algorithm to split training patches instead of the pixels (or objects) that compose them. This modified algorithm does not overestimate accuracy and has no lower predictive capability than the original. When its results are validated with an external data-set, the accuracy is not different from that obtained with the original algorithm. We analysed three remote sensing images with different classification approaches (pixel and object based); in the three cases reported, the modification we propose produces a less biased accuracy estimation.},

The proposed approach extends traditional risk assess-ments beyond material damages; complements quantitative and semi-quantitative data with subjective and local knowl-edge, improving the use of commonly available information; and produces estimates of model uncertainty by providing probability distributions for all of its outputs. Flood risk to people is modeled using a spatially explicit Bayesian net-work model calibrated on expert opinion. Risk is assessed in terms of (1) likelihood of non-fatal physical injury, (2) like-lihood of post-traumatic stress disorder and (3) likelihood of death. The study area covers the lower part of the Sihl valley (Switzerland) including the city of Zurich. The model is used to estimate the effect of improving an existing early warning system, taking into account the reliability, lead time and scope (i.e., coverage of people reached by the warning). Model results indicate that the potential benefits of an im-proved early warning in terms of avoided human impacts are particularly relevant in case of a major flood event.},

The NDC is also noteworthy in focussing on emissions from deforestation control and land use change. Agricultural intensification is a key component of the offer, potentially allowing the country to make credible mitigation commitments that are aligned with a national development strategy of halting deforestation in the Amazon, and increasing livestock production. This apparent contradiction is potentially resolved by understanding the technical, economic and policy feasibility of intensification by pasture restoration. We use bio-economic modelling to demonstrate the extent of cost-effective mitigation that could be delivered by this measure, and to show a result that underpins the target of zero deforestation in Brazil. The analysis was requested by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture prior to the NDC announcement at COP21 by the Government of Brazil. The study provided the basis of the livestock sector contribution to the NDC and highlights the on-going role of effective deforestation control policies. It also contributes to the global debate on land sparing by sustainable agricultural intensification.},

abstract = {Information on the geographic variation in soil has traditionally been presented in polygon (choropleth) maps at coarse scales. Now scientists, planners, managers and politicians want quantitative information on the variation and functioning of soil at finer resolutions; they want it to plan better land use for agriculture, water supply and the mitigation of climate change land degradation and desertification. The GlobalSoilMap project aims to produce a grid of soil attributes at a fine spatial resolution (approximately 100 m), and at six depths, for the purpose. This paper describes the three-dimensional spatial modelling used to produce the Australian soil grid, which consists of Australia-wide soil attribute maps. The modelling combines historical soil data plus estimates derived from visible and infrared soil spectra. Together they provide a good coverage of data across Australia. The soil attributes so far include sand, silt and clay contents, bulk density, available water capacity, organic carbon, pH, effective cation exchange capacity, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. The data on these attributes were harmonised to six depth layers, namely 0–0.05 m, 0.05–0.15 m, 0.15–0.30 m, 0.30–0.60 m, 0.60–1.00 m and 1.00–2.00 m, and the resulting values were incorporated simultaneously in the models. The modelling itself combined the bootstrap, a decision tree with piecewise regression on environmental variables and geostatistical modelling of residuals. At each layer, values of the soil attributes were predicted at the nodes of a 3 arcsecond (approximately 90 m) grid and mapped together with their uncertainties. The assessment statistics for each attribute mapped show that the models explained between 30{\%} and 70{\%} of their total variation. The outcomes are illustrated with maps of sand, silt and clay contents and their uncertainties. The Australian three-dimensional soil maps fill a significant gap in the availability of quantitative soil information in Australia.},

abstract = {Global inventories of spatial and vertical distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are being used in national and global initiatives targeted to mitigate climate change and land degradation impacts. Yet, national level high-resolution estimates of SOC stocks can be useful for improving the accuracy of global SOC inventories. We estimated spatially resolved SOC stocks of surface 0–30 cm and subsurface 30–100 cm layers at a spatial resolution of 30 m in tropical Island, Sri Lanka using a legacy harmonized soil database of 122 soil profiles. The national estimates were compared with two global estimates derived from WISE30sec and SoilGrids250m. The tropical Island (land area = 64,610 km2) occupying 0.03{\%} of global land area showed a considerable heterogeneity in SOC stocks ranging from 2.0–342.5 Mg ha−1 and 2.7–391.7 Mg ha−1 in the surface and subsurface soil layers, respectively. We found, elevation, precipitation and slope angle as main environmental controllers of the spatial distribution of SOC stocks under tropical climate. Incorporating the pedogenic information (derived from soil series level legacy map, soil orders and suborders) with environmental controllers resulted in better regression models of predicting surface (R2 = 0.61) and subsurface (R2 = 0.81) SOC stocks. Geographically weighted regression kriging derived maps of SOC stocks revealed that 0–100 cm soil layer of the tropical Island stored 500 Tg C contributing for 0.04{\%} of the global SOC stocks. The validation results of our estimates showed low Mean Estimation Error (MEE: surface −1.6 and subsurface −1.6 Mg ha−1) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE: surface 29.5 and subsurface 24.9 Mg ha−1) indicating a low bias and satisfactory predictions. The relative improvement of the prediction accuracy of the SOC stocks of our geospatial estimates in the 0–30 cm layer in comparison to SoilGrids250m and WISE30sec data derived SOC stocks were 51.7{\%} and 35.2{\%}, respectively. The SOC stocks predictions of the 30–100 cm soil layer showed even better relative improvement compared to SoilGrids250m (78.4{\%}) and WISE30sec (57.4{\%}) SOC estimates. Compared to estimates of total SOC stocks resulted in this study, WISE30sec data derived SOC stock maps showed 30{\%} over estimation of the C stock in surface 0–30 cm (332 Tg C) and 41{\%} overestimation in 30–100 cm layer (343 Tg C). The over estimation of total SOC stocks by the SoilGrids250 SOC stocks map for the surface 0–30 cm layer was 122{\%} (567 Tg C) and for the 30–100 cm layer it was 209{\%} (750 Tg C). We conclude that the fusion of legacy soil information of SOC stocks with appropriate environmental covariates and pedogenic information derived from legacy area-class soil maps at national level can produce more accurate inventories of spatial and vertical distribution of SOC stocks. These national inventories have a great potential of upgrading global inventories of SOC stocks.},

abstract = {Soil, through its various functions, plays a vital role in the Earth's ecosystems and provides multiple ecosystem services to humanity. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are simple to complex knowledge rules that relate available soil information to soil properties and variables that are needed to parameterize soil processes. In this paper, we review the existing PTFs and document the new generation of PTFs developed in the different disciplines of Earth system science. To meet the methodological challenges for a successful application in Earth system modeling, we emphasize that PTF development has to go hand in hand with suitable extrapolation and upscaling techniques such that the PTFs correctly represent the spatial heterogeneity of soils. PTFs should encompass the variability of the estimated soil property or process, in such a way that the estimation of parameters allows for validation and can also confidently provide for extrapolation and upscaling purposes capturing the spatial variation in soils. Most actively pursued recent developments are related to parameterizations of solute transport, heat exchange, soil respiration, and organic carbon content, root density, and vegetation water uptake. Further challenges are to be addressed in parameterization of soil erosivity and land use change impacts at multiple scales. We argue that a comprehensive set of PTFs can be applied throughout a wide range of disciplines of Earth system science, with emphasis on land surface models. Novel sensing techniques provide a true breakthrough for this, yet further improvements are necessary for methods to deal with uncertainty and to validate applications at global scale.},

We first summarize the major differences in the geomorphological literature and then investigate each one proposing current best practices and few methodological developments. The latter is mainly represented by a widely used approach in statistics for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection in generalized linear models, namely the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO).

We aimed to compare multispectral satellite image and relief parameters for the quantification and mapping of clay and sand contents. The Temporal Synthetic Spectral (TESS) reflectance and Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI) approaches were used to identify and characterize texture spectral signatures at the image level. Soil samples were collected (0{\&}ndash;20 cm depth, 919 points) from an area of 14,614 km2 in Brazil for reference and model calibration. We compared different prediction approaches: (a) TESS and SYSI; (b) Relief-Derived Covariates (RDC); and (c) SYSI plus RDC. The TESS method produced highly similar behavior to the laboratory convolved data. The sandy textural class showed a greater increase in average spectral reflectance from Band 1 to 7 compared with the clayey class. The prediction using SYSI produced a better result for clay (R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 65.0 g kg{\&}minus;1) and sand (R2 = 0.86; RMSE = 79.9 g kg{\&}minus;1).

@article{Reis2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 British Society of Soil Science The soil water retention curve (SWRC) is an essential hydraulic function for the understanding and modelling of soil hydraulic processes. Its direct determination is time consuming and sometimes expensive because it requires extensive sampling, especially when spatial and temporal variation of soil hydraulic properties are an issue. The use of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) is a viable alternative to predict the parameters of SWRC from more easily determined soil attributes. Splintex is a physically based engineering model containing two PTFs to estimate SWRC parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity, but its performance and functionality have not yet been fully evaluated and disseminated for soil science. We examined the functionality of the PTFs available in Splintex to estimate parameters of the Van Genuchten–Mualem (VGM) SWRC equation with a laboratory-measured dataset containing information on particle size, bulk and particle density, saturated water content and parameters of the SWRCs. In addition, we tested the performance of both PTFs for deriving some soil physical–structural variables calculated from estimated SWRC parameters. Compared with VGM parameters fitted to the laboratory dataset, the model performed well. Its predictive performance for soil air capacity, relative field capacity and soil physical–structural quality indices was also evaluated. The performance of Splintex for estimating the VGM parameters depended on the combined effect of all input variables rather than on isolated correlations between an input variable and a model parameter. Highlights: Splintex provides two PTFs to estimate the Van Genuchten–Mualem parameters of the SWRC. In addition to PTF1 input, PTF2 needs an additional soil water content–retention observation. Performance of Splintex-PTF1 against measured data and -PTF2 prediction is presented. PTF2 provided better results than PTF1 for estimating SPQ indices.},

abstract = {Summary This study introduces a hybrid spatial modelling framework, which accounts for spatial non-stationarity, spatial autocorrelation and environmental correlation. A set of geographic spatially autocorrelated Euclidean distance fields (EDF) was used to provide additional spatially relevant predictors to the environmental covariates commonly used for mapping. The approach was used in combination with machine-learning methods, so we called the method Euclidean distance fields in machine-learning (EDM). This method provides advantages over other prediction methods that integrate spatial dependence and state factor models, for example, regression kriging (RK) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). We used seven generic (EDFs) and several commonly used predictors with different regression algorithms in two digital soil mapping (DSM) case studies and compared the results to those achieved with ordinary kriging (OK), RK and GWR as well as the multiscale methods ConMap, ConStat and contextual spatial modelling (CSM). The algorithms tested in EDM were a linear model, bagged multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), radial basis function support vector machines (SVM), Cubist, random forest (RF) and a neural network (NN) ensemble. The study demonstrated that DSM with EDM provided results comparable to RK and to the contextual multiscale methods. Best results were obtained with Cubist, RF and bagged MARS. Because the tree-based approaches produce discontinuous response surfaces, the resulting maps can show visible artefacts when only the EDFs are used as predictors (i.e. no additional environmental covariates). Artefacts were not obvious for SVM and NN and to a lesser extent bagged MARS. An advantage of EDM is that it accounts for spatial non-stationarity and spatial autocorrelation when using a small set of additional predictors. The EDM is a new method that provides a practical alternative to more conventional spatial modelling and thus it enhances the DSM toolbox. Highlights We present a hybrid mapping approach that accounts for spatial dependence and environmental correlation. The approach is based on a set of generic Euclidean distance fields (EDF). Our Euclidean distance fields in machine learning (EDM) can model non-stationarity and spatial autocorrelation. The EDM approach eliminates the need for kriging of residuals and produces accurate digital soil maps.},

abstract = {Soil available water capacity is an important soil property for land use planning, drought risk assessment, and modelling crop production or carbon cycling. Measurements of soil moisture at several soil water potentials are expensive and time-consuming, hence it is common to estimate available water capacity with pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Available PTFs for France rarely provide uncertainty estimates for the model coefficients and predictions, which are often required for error propagation analysis and modelling ecological processes. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop class-PTFs and 2) continuous-PTFs with associated uncertainties, and 3) to assess the domain of applicability of the PTFs across metropolitan France. We used the SOLHYDRO database for calibrating continuous and class PTFs. For continuous PTFs we used linear regression models using sand, clay, organic carbon (SOC), and bulk density (BD) as predictor variables, whereas class-PTFs were defined by texture class, bulk density, and horizon type (all horizons, topsoils, subsoils). The models were validated with an independent validation dataset. The domain of applicability of the PTFs was evaluated calculating the Mahalanobis distance between the calibration dataset and horizon data from the French soil monitoring network (RMQS). At independent validation, texture class-PTFs had a RMSE between 0.047 cm 3 cm-3 and 0.058 cm 3 cm-3 and continuous-PTFs had a RMSE between 0.040 cm 3 cm-3 and 0.053 cm 3 cm-3. Texture class-PTFs had similar or better predictive performance than texture-structural class-PTFs. The prediction performance of continuous-PTFs improved slightly when including SOC and BD in the models. The variance of the predictions of continuous-PTFs associated to error in the model coefficients was rather small, and increased as the values of the predictor variables were more distant to the centroid of the calibration data. We provide the PTF users with tools for classifying new samples as within or outside the applicability domain of the PTFs. When applied to the RMQS dataset, {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the horizons outside the domain of applicability were located in forests and natural areas or managed pastures. The spatial distribution of RMQS horizons outside the domain of applicability of the PTF can inform future sampling locations for increasing the diversity of the soil properties and site conditions represented by the SOLHYDRO dataset.},

abstract = {Measurement of soil bulk density is important for understanding the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil. Accurate and rapid soil bulk density measurement techniques play a significant role in agricultural experimental research. This review is a comprehensive summary of existing measurement methods and evaluates their advantages, disadvantages, potential sources of error, and directions for future development. These techniques can be broadly categorised as direct and indirect methods. Direct methods include core, clod, and excavation sampling, whereas indirect methods include the radiation and regression approaches. The core method is most widely used, but it is time consuming and difficult to use for sampling multiple soil depths. The size of the coring cylinder used, operator experience, sampling depth, and in-situ soil moisture content significantly affect its accuracy. The clod method is suitable for use with heavy clay soils, and its accuracy is dependent on equipment calibration, drying time, and operator experience, but the process is complicated and time consuming. Excavation techniques are most commonly used to evaluate the bulk density of forest soils, but have major limitations as they cannot be used in soils with large pores and their measurement accuracy is strongly influenced by soil texture and the type of analysis selected. The indirect methods appear to have greater accuracy than direct approaches, but have higher costs, are more complex, and require greater operator experience. One such approach uses gamma radiation, and its accuracy is strongly influenced by soil depth. Regression methods are economical as they can make indirect measurements, but these depend on good, quality data of soil texture and organic matter content and geographical and climatic properties. Also, like most of the other approaches, its accuracy decreases with sampling depth.},

abstract = {SOC is the most important indicator of soil fertility and monitoring its space-time changes is a prerequisite to establish strategies to reduce soil loss and preserve its quality. Here we modelled the topsoil (0–0.3 m) SOC concentration of the cultivated area of Sicily in 1993 and 2008. Sicily is an extremely variable region with a high number of ecosystems, soils, and microclimates. We studied the role of time and land use in the modelling of SOC, and assessed the role of remote sensing (RS) covariates in the boosted regression trees modelling. The models obtained showed a high pseudo-R2 (0.63–0.69) and low uncertainty (s.d. {\textless}0.76 g C kg− 1 with RS, and {\textless}1.25 g C kg− 1 without RS). These outputs allowed depicting a time variation of SOC at 1 arcsec. SOC estimation strongly depended on the soil texture, land use, rainfall and topographic indices related to erosion and deposition. RS indices captured one fifth of the total variance explained, slightly changed the ranking of variance explained by the non-RS predictors, and reduced the variability of the model replicates. During the study period, SOC decreased in the areas with relatively high initial SOC, and increased in the area with high temperature and low rainfall, dominated by arables. This was likely due to the compulsory application of some Good Agricultural and Environmental practices. These results confirm that the importance of texture and land use in short-term SOC variation is comparable to climate. The present results call for agronomic and policy intervention at the district level to maintain fertility and yield potential. In addition, the present results suggest that the application of RS covariates enhanced the modelling performance.},

abstract = {The variation of soil properties down a profile is usually considered continuous. The aim of this study was to develop and test a methodology to model the continuous vertical and lateral distributions of SOC stocks in Scottish soils making explicit the modelling and spatial uncertainty of the results. A comparison with regression kriging and other depth function methods is provided to show that better performances can be achieved taking into account non-linear relationships between covariates and soil properties. The analysis was run for the whole of Scotland. The carbon stocks were calculated for each point, i.e. each horizon in each available profile. The stock value at each cell for each of the considered depth layers was defined using a hybrid GAM-geostatistical 3D model, combining: 1) the fitting of a GAM to estimate the trend of the variable, using a 3D smoother with related covariates; and 2) kriging or Gaussian simulations of GAM residuals as spatial component to account for local details. The use of GAM makes the approach flexible, because it is able to deal with both linear and non-linear relationships between soil properties and the considered covariates. The results confirmed that MODIS data are a useful source of information for DSM especially at national scale. When comparing the proposed approach with similar methods such as regression kriging, the results showed better agreement with the data in the validation set with a global R2 of 0.60. The median values obtained are comparable with the values reported from previous studies on stocks in Scotland using different methods. The uncertainty is large indicating a wide range of credible values for each pixel. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Disaggregation of conventional soil surveys has been identified as a potential source for much of the next generation of model-ready digital soil spatial data. This process aims to apportion vector soil surveys into raster (gridded) representations of the component soils that are often aggregated together in map unit designs. Most soil surveys are published with some description of the soil-landscape relationships that distinguish component soils within map units. We used these descriptions found in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of Webster and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, USA, to build a set of representative training areas for all soil components by using 1-arc second digital elevation data and derived geomorphic indices. These training areas were then used in classification tree ensembles with a more extensive environmental database to transform the original SSURGO map into a gridded soil series map. We created underlying prediction frequency surfaces from the models that can be used for creating continuous representations of soil class and property distributions. Disaggregation models matched training sets in 71{\%}-74{\%} of pixels and matched components in original SSURGO map units in 56{\%}-65{\%} of the study area. We evaluated both the original SSURGO data and our models using 87 independent pedons not used in model building. Validation pedons matched components in SSURGO map units at 39{\%} of sites, but in map units that only included one named component (as opposed to multiple soils that could be matched to validation pedons) only 27{\%} of the sites matched. Disaggregation predictions matched validation pedon classes 22-24{\%} of the time using nearest neighbor spatial matches, and these rates increased to 39-44{\%} for correct predictions within a 60-meter radius of the pedon. To characterize uncertainty, we compared relative ensemble prediction frequency (probability) of final hardened model classes at validation sites. Sites with correct predictions had generally higher prediction frequencies; which lead us to use them to create an uncertainty model. Uncertainty was calculated by determining the rate of correct predictions at validation sites within different intervals of prediction frequencies using nearest neighbor validation results. We were able to discern four uncertainty classes with values of 7{\%}, 18{\%}, 20{\%} and 43{\%}, which we called "ground truth probabilities". We present the methods to create these models as a specific example of how disaggregation techniques may be used to aid in updating national soil survey inventories. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cation exchange capacity (CEC), as an important indicator for soil quality, represents soil's ability to hold positively charged ions. We attempted to predict CEC using different statistical methods including monotone analysis of variance (MONANOVA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), principal components regressions (PCR), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in order to compare the utility of these approaches and identify the best predictor. We analyzed 170 soil samples from four different nations (USA, Spain, Iran and Iraq) under three land uses (agriculture, pasture, and forest). Seventy percent of the samples (120 samples) were selected as the calibration set and the remaining 50 samples (30{\%}) were used as the prediction set. The results indicated that the MONANOVA (R2 = 0.82 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 6.32) and ANNs (R2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 5.53) were the best models to estimate CEC, PSO (R2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 5.54) and PCR (R2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 6.48) also worked well and the results were very similar to each other. While the most influential variables for the various countries and land uses were different and CEC was affected by different variables in different situations, clay (positively correlated) and sand (negatively correlated) were the most influential variables for predicting CEC for the entire data set. Although the MANOVA and ANNs provided good predictions of the entire dataset, PSO gives a formula to estimate soil CEC using commonly tested soil properties. Therefore, PSO shows promise as a technique to estimate soil CEC. Establishing effective pedotransfer functions to predict CEC would be productive where there are limitations of time and money, and other commonly analyzed soil properties are available.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to apply a k-NN approach to predict CEC in Iranian soils and compare this approach with the popular artificial neural network model (ANN). In this study, a data set of 3420 soil samples from different parts of Iran was used. Two different sets of cheaper-to-measure soil attributes were selected as potential predictors. The first set consisted of clay, silt, sand and organic carbon (OC) contents. The second data set was constructed using OC and clay contents. Two 'design-parameter' parameters should be optimized before application of the k-NN approach. Results showed that the algorithm efficiency is not dependent on these parameters. A wide range of suboptimal values around the optimal values may cause a slight error in terms of estimation accuracy. However, the optimal settings of the design-parameters depend on the size of the development/reference data set. In both k-NN and ANN models, the higher number of input variables can relatively improve the estimation of CEC. But this improvement was not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Furthermore, the results showed that increasing the size of the reference data set to a certain amount (N = 1200) reduced the estimation error significantly in terms of root-mean-squared residuals (RMSE). However, no significant difference in the accuracy of k-NN and ANN methods was detected in the reference data set sizes for N {\textgreater}1200. Results showed no significant difference between this approach and ANN models, suggesting the competitive advantage of the k-NN technique over other techniques to develop pedotransfer functions (PTFs), for example, the redevelopment of PTFs is not necessarily required as new data become available.},

abstract = {The rapid developments in the acquisition of data on soil should enable pedologists to update existing digital soil maps readily. The methods by which that is done must take into account temporal change in soil properties and local differences in spatial variation. The common mapping techniques will have to be modified to make full use of digital data. We show what can be achieved with a case study on updating maps of soil organic matter (SOM) in Jiangsu Province, China, with three sets of soil data collected in the 1980s, 2000 and 2006. Our results showed that temporal changes in SOM between the three sampling periods occurred in only very small parts of the regions. Models of spatial variation of SOM based on the data collected in the 1980s and 2006 for the whole region differed somewhat, whereas models based on the data collected in the 1980s, 2000 and 2006 for the Taihu region (south Jiangsu) were significantly different. As updating with Bayesian maximum entropy continued, the accuracy of prediction increased and that of the prediction variance decreased. Finally, our study leads us to suggest improved technologies for updating digital soil maps with new data.},

abstract = {There is a consensus about the necessity to achieve a quick soil spatial information with few human resources. Remote/proximal sensing and pedotransference are methods that can be integrated into this approach. On the other hand, there is still a lack of strategies indicating on how to put this in practice, especially in the tropics. Thus, the objective of this work was to suggest a strategy for the spatial prediction of soil classes by using soil spectroscopy from ground laboratory spectra to space images platform, as associated with terrain attributes and spectral libraries. The study area is located in S{\~{a}}o Paulo State, Brazil, which was covered by a regular grid (one per ha), with 473 boreholes collected at top and undersurface. All soil samples were analyzed in laboratory (granulometry and chemical), and scanned with a VIS-NIR-SWIR (400–2500 nm) spectroradiometer. We developed two traditional pedological maps with different detail levels for comparison: TFS-1 regarding orders and subgroups; and TFS-2 with additional information such as color, iron and fertility. Afterwards, we performed a digital soil map, generated by models, which used the following information: (i) predicted soil attributes from undersurface layer (diagnostic horizon), obtained by using a local spectral library; (ii) spectral reflectance of a bare soil surface obtained by Landsat image; and (iii) derivative of terrain attributes. Thus, the digital map was generated by a combination of three variables: remote sensing (Landsat data), proximal sensing (laboratory spectroscopy) and relief. Landsat image with bare soil was used as a first observation of surface. This strategy assisted on the location of topossequences to achieve soil variation in the area. Afterwards, spectral undersurface information from these locations was used to modelize soil attributes quantification (156 samples). The model was used to quantify samples in the entire area by spectra (other 317 samples). Since the surface was bare soil, it was sampled by image spectroscopy. Indeed, topsoil spectral laboratory information presented great similarity with satellite spectra. We observed angle variation on spectra from clayey to sandy soils as differentiated by intensity. Soil lines between bands 3/4 and 5/7 were helpful on the link between laboratory and satellite data. The spectral models of soil attributes (i.e., clay, sand, and iron) presented a high predictive performance (R2 0.71 to 0.90) with low error. The spatial prediction of these attributes also presented a high performance (validations with R2 {\textgreater}0.78). The models increased spatial resolution of soil weathering information using a known spectral library. Elevation (altitude) improved mapping due to correlation with soil attributes (i.e., clay, iron and chemistry). We observed a close relationship between soil weathering index map and laboratory spectra + image spectra + relief parameters. The color composite of the 5R, 4G and 3B had great performance on the detection of soils along topossequences, since colors went from dark blue to light purple, and were related with soil texture and mineralogy of the region. The comparison between the traditional and digital soil maps showed a global accuracy of 69{\%} for the TFS-1 map and 62{\%} in the TFS-2, with kappa indices of 0.52 and 0.45, respectively. We randomly validated both digital and traditional maps with individual plots at field. We achieve a 75{\%} and 80{\%} agreement for digital and traditional maps, respectively, which allows us to conclude that traditional map is not necessarily the truth and digital is very close. The key of the strategy was to use bare soil image as a first step on the indication of soil variation in the area, indicating in-situ location for sample collection in all depths. The current strategy is innovative since we linked sensors from ground to space in addition with relief parameters and spectral libraries. The strategy indicates a more accurate map with less soil samples and lower cost.},

abstract = {This research aimed to implement and compare the accuracy of different interpolation methods using cross validation errors for interpolating the spatial pattern of soil properties. This paper investigates whether the use of kriging, instead of traditional interpolation methods, improves the accuracy of prediction of soil properties. To this end, various interpolation (kriging) techniques that rely on the spatial correlation between observations to predict attribute values at ensampled locations are studied. Geostatistics provides descriptive tools such as semivariograms to characterize the spatial pattern of continuous and categorical soil attributes. The maps obtained from Ordinary Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting and splines show clearly that the map from Universal Kriging (UK) is better than the other three interpolation methods. Therefore, UK can be considered as an accurate method for interpolating soil (EC, pH, CaCO3) properties.},

abstract = {Soil is very important for many land functions. To achieve sustainability it is important to understand how soils vary over space in the landscape. Remote sensing data can be instrumental in mapping and spatial modelling of soil properties, resources and their variability. The aims of this study were to compare satellite sensors (MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) with varying spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) of a set of soil properties in Scotland, evaluate the potential benefits of adding Sentinel-1 data to DSM models, select the most suited mix of sensors for DSM to map the considered set of soil properties and validate the results of topsoil (2D) and whole profile (3D) models. The results showed that the use of a mixture of sensors proved more effective to model and map soil properties than single sensors. The use of radar Sentinel-1 data proved useful for all soil properties, improving the prediction capability of models with only optical bands. The use of MODIS time series provided stronger relationships than the use of temporal snapshots. The results showed good validation statistics with a RMSE below 20{\%} of the range for all considered soil properties. The RMSE improved from previous studies including only MODIS sensor and using a coarser prediction grid. The performance of the models was similar to previous studies at regional, national or continental scale. A mix of optical and radar data proved useful to map soil properties along the profile. The produced maps of soil properties describing both lateral and vertical variability, with associated uncertainty, are important for further modelling and management of soil resources and ecosystem services. Coupled with further data the soil properties maps could be used to assess soil functions and therefore conditions and suitability of soils for a range of purposes.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that the pattern of land surface dynamic feedbacks (LSDF) based on remote sensing images after a rainfall event can be used to derive environmental covariates to assist in predicting soil texture variation over low-relief areas. However, the impact of the rainfall magnitude on the performance of these covariates has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate this impact during ten observation periods following rainfall events of different magnitudes (0–40 mm). An individual predictive soil mapping method (iPSM) was used to predict soil texture over space based on the environmental covariates derived from land surface dynamic feedbacks. The prediction error showed strong negative correlation with rainfall magnitude (Pearson's r between root-mean squared error of prediction and rainfall magnitude = −0.943 for percentage of sand and −0.883 for percentage of clay). When the rainfall reaches a certain magnitude, the prediction error becomes stable. The recommended rain magnitude (threshold) using LSDF method in this study area is larger than 20 mm for both sand and clay percentage. The predictive maps based on different observed periods with similar rainfall magnitudes show only slight differences. Rainfall magnitude can thus be said to have a significant impact on the prediction accuracy of soil texture mapping. Greater rainfall magnitude will improve the prediction accuracy when using the LSDF. And high wind speed, high evaporation and low relative humidity during the observed periods also improved the prediction accuracy, all by stimulating differential soil drying.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal characterization of soil properties in agro-ecosystems is crucial for monitoring the evolution of soil functions and for understanding the main influential processes. Moreover, the objective mapping of soil properties in agro-ecosystems is urgently needed for regional planning purposes and the proper choice of land management practices. In this work, the geostatistical analysis of a dataset of soil properties, derived from 2411 soil samples collected in Vukovar-Srijem County (Croatia), highlighted the multiple benefits of a spatial-statistical approach. The main aim of this paper is to jointly examine short-range (i.e., within-field) and regional spatial variability of several soil chemical properties: soil pH, organic matter (OM), plant available phosphorus (AP) and potassium (AK). The available sampling network, characterized by a set of 2411 (0–30 cm depth) irregularly and field-clustered soil samples, allowed to derivate of two typologies of soil nutrient maps by means of ordinary block kriging: within-field high-resolution maps (block size 250 m) and regional low-resolution maps (block size 2000 m). Soil pH and OM had lower variability compared to AP and AK. The OM content and pH ranged from 1.24{\%} to 5.25{\%} and from 3.69 to 7.84, respectively. Almost 94{\%} of all samples had an OM content below 3{\%}, indicating the need for future adoption of environmentally friendly soil management in this county. The mean values of AP and AK were 173 mg kg− 1and 238 mg kg− 1, respectively, indicating a moderate supply of these nutrients. Geostatistical analysis revealed that the best-fit models were spherical for pH and AP, with moderate spatial dependency, and exponential for OM and AK, with strong spatial dependency. The within-field high-resolution soil property maps can be used as guidance for site-specific fertilization and liming. In addition, the regional maps derived for larger interpolation support provide quantitative information for regional planning and environmental monitoring and protection purposes. Consequently, the multi-resolution mapping of soil properties and the analysis of their spatial variability highlighted possible connections with influential factors and processes, including the relationships with different soil types. Finally, quantification of the spatial variability of soil properties by means of variogram models constitutes a basis for optimizing soil sample spacing for mapping purposes in the studied region.},

This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England {\&} Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30tCha−1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3GtCyear−1, which effectively offset 20–35{\%} of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers.},

abstract = {In the Anthropocene, processes and response feedbacks to soil-ecosystems have acceler- ated, jeopardizing the sustainability of the soil resource at local, regional, national, and global scales. Soil-ecosystems are at the heart of the critical zone and sustain life on Earth by providing a quasi non-re- newable resource that, once degraded, is extremely slow to restore. Yet global change, such as population growth, climate change, and drastically altered land use, imposes profound imprints onto soil-ecosystems impacting soil quality, biodiversity, and food security. Questions emerge about the role of digital soil map- ping (DSM) in the context of a changing world. Implementations of contemporary digital soil models have emphasized mapping of soil-forming or SCORPAN factors assuming that they are more or less static to infer on soil properties or classes. This perspective is constraining and does not capture soil evolution, i.e., the change of soil properties and their environmental covariates through time. We have proposed to enhance conceptual soil models to explicitly incorporate the soil-ecosystem evolution and anthropogenic forcings into the modeling process. Our space-time modeling framework, called STEP- AWBH (“step-up”), consists of soil (S), topographic (T), ecological (E), geologic (P), atmospheric (A), water (W), and biotic properties (B) as well as human-induced forcings (H) to predict pixel-based soil properties or behavior. We discuss how contemporary DSM can be expanded to enhance capabilities to respond to grand challenges we face at global scale linked to sustainability, vulnerability, adaptability, and risk assessments of soil-ecosystems across multiple spatial and temporal scales},

abstract = {Conventional survey methods have efficiencies in medium to low intensity survey because they use relationships between soil properties and more readily observable environmental features as a basis for mapping. However, the implicit predictive models are qualitative, complex and rarely communicated in a clear manner. The possibility of developing an explicit analogue of conventional survey practice suited to medium to low intensity surveys is considered. A key feature is the use of quantitative environmental variables from digital terrain analysis and airborne gamma radiometric remote sensing to predict the spatial distribution of soil properties. The use of these technologies for quantitative soil survey is illustrated using an example from the Bago and Maragle State Forests in southeastern Australia. A design-based, stratified, two-stage sampling scheme was adopted for the 50,000 ha area using digital geology, landform and climate as stratifying variables. The landform and climate variables were generated using a high resolution digital elevation model with a grid size of 25 m. Site and soil data were obtained from 165 sites. Regression trees and generalised linear models were then used to generate spatial predictions of soil properties using digital terrain and gamma radiometric survey data as explanatory variables. The resulting environmental correlation models generate spatial predictions with a fine grain unmatched by comparable conventional survey methods. Example models and spatial predictions are presented for soil profile depth, total phosphorus and total carbon. The models account for 42{\%}, 78{\%} and 54{\%} of the variance present in the sample respectively. The role of spatial dependence, issues of scale and landscape complexity are discussed along with the capture of expert knowledge. It is suggested that environmental correlation models may form a useful trend model for various forms of kriging if spatial dependence is evident in the residuals of the model.},

abstract = {It is well known that the world is rich with soil data resulting from the efforts of past soil surveys. However, the majority of these data is largely unused. These legacy soil data come in the form of soil maps, soil survey reports, soil profile descriptions, and/or in the format of antiquated "card catalogue". These data provide many benefits including soil information preservation or as a major component of national environmental monitoring or as the only source of meaningful soil information for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) in many of data-scarce countries of the developing world. These benefits call for the rejuvenation of these data. In Nigeria, as one of the data-poor countries in terms of modern soil digital soil databases, there is a preponderance of largely untapped legacy soil data as a result of her rich history of soil surveys. This paper provides an account of the challenges faced in the course of the renewal of the Nigerian legacy soil data for the purpose of DSM. In telling this account, we briefly review the processes involved. We then explore the historical soil surveys in Nigeria leading to the synthesis and discussion of the challenges of the processes used for the capture and renewal of the legacy soil data including how the challenges were overcome. {\textcopyright}2012 Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {80{\%} of arable land in Africa has low soil fertility and suffers from physical soil problems. Additionally, significant amounts of nutrients are lost every year due to unsustainable soil management practices. This is partially the result of insufficient use of soil management knowledge. To help bridge the soil information gap in Africa, the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project was established in 2008. Over the period 2008-2014, the AfSIS project compiled two point data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database and the AfSIS Sentinel Site database. These data sets contain over 28 thousand sampling locations and represent the most comprehensive soil sample data sets of the African continent to date. Utilizing these point data sets in combination with a large number of covariates, we have generated a series of spatial predictions of soil properties relevant to the agricultural management-organic carbon, pH, sand, silt and clay fractions, bulk density, cation-exchange capacity, total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, Al content and exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg, Na). We specifically investigate differences between two predictive approaches: random forests and linear regression. Results of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the random forests algorithm consistently outperforms the linear regression algorithm, with average decreases of 15-75{\%} in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across soil properties and depths. Fitting and running random forests models takes an order of magnitude more time and the modelling success is sensitive to artifacts in the input data, but as long as quality-controlled point data are provided, an increase in soil mapping accuracy can be expected. Results also indicate that globally predicted soil classes (USDA Soil Taxonomy, especially Alfisols and Mollisols) help improve continental scale soil property mapping, and are among the most important predictors. This indicates a promising potential for transferring pedological knowledge from data rich countries to countries with limited soil data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved. Knowledge of soils is increasingly important for their correct use in agriculture, in urban growth, and in conservation of natural resources, among other purposes. However, there is a lack of qualified professionals for pedological characterization and mapping, particularly at scales of greater detail. Due to this shortage and due to advances in computational tools and remote sensing, Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) arose in order to assist and expedite pedological survey activities. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a method for delineation of soil units in toposequences through the spectral response of soils in the Vis-NIR (Visible-Near Infrared) wavelength. The spectral method consisted of obtaining soil spectral curves by means of a spectroradiometer, FieldSpec Pro, and reduction in the amount of spectral information by Principal Component Analysis, followed by clustering of samples by the fuzzy k-means method. Five toposequences with 30 m equidistant points were selected for soil class characterization and sampling. Eight distinct soil classes were identified and received detailed characterization and classification in pedological profiles. For the remaining points, the characterization of soil classes was based on the soil classification contained in the pedological profiles, with samples collected using a soil auger at depths of 0.00-0.20 and 0.80-1.00 m, for a total of 162 samples across the five toposequences. The samples were analyzed by the conventional and spectral method so that the results could be compared and evaluated. Thus, morphological, physical (texture), and chemical analyses of soil samples were made. In the five toposequences studied, the results were similar, and some soils were not perfectly individualized by spectral method, due to great similarity in their spectral curves, as demonstrated by Latossolo Vermelho F{\'{e}}rrico and Nitossolo Vermelho F{\'{e}}rrico. The spectral method was able to differentiate soils with distinct spectral responses and establish limits in toposequences, showing great potential for implementation in soil surveys.},

abstract = {Conventional soil maps, as the major data source for information on the spatial variation of soil, are limited in terms of both the level of spatial detail and the accuracy of soil attributes. These soil maps, however, contain valuable knowledge on soil-environment relationships. Such knowledge can be extracted for updating conventional soil maps through the use of available high-quality data on environmental variables and data analysis techniques. We developed a method to update conventional soil maps using digital soil mapping techniques without additional field work, which can be used in situations where the study area contains no or few soil profile descriptions at points. The basis of the method is that soil polygons on a conventional soil map correspond to landscape units, which can be considered as combinations of environmental factors. Such environmental combinations were approximated through fuzzy clustering on the environmental factors. We extracted the knowledge on soil-environment relationships by relating the environmental combinations to the mapped soil types. The extracted knowledge was then used for soil mapping using the Soil Land Inference Model (SoLIM) framework. This method was demonstrated through a case study for updating a conventional 1:20,000 soil map of Wakefield, NB, Canada. The case study showed that the updated digital soil map contained much greater spatial detail than the conventional soil map. Field validation indicated that the accuracy of the updated soil map was much higher than the conventional soil map at the level of soil associations with drainage classes, indicating that the proposed method is an effective approach to updating conventional soil maps.},

For example, advances in geographic information science, digital terrain modeling, remote sensing, fuzzy logic has created a tremendous potential for improvement in the way that soil maps are produced. The State Factor soil-forming model, which was introduced to the western world by one of the early Presidents of the American Association of Geographers (C.F. Marbut), forms the theoretical basis of PSM. PSM research is being driven by a need to understand the role soil plays in the biophysical and biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Much research has been published on the subject in the last 20 years (mostly outside of geographic journals) and methods have varied widely from statistical approaches (including geostatistics) to more complex methods, such as decision tree analysis, and expert systems. A geographic perspective is needed because of the inherently geographic nature of PSM.},

abstract = {Soil is one of the most important natural resource and its heterogeneity reflects the variability of its chemical and physical attributes. Soil heterogeneity occurs due to the natural process of formation and use by men and management. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the spatial variability of physical and chemical soil attributes and map the spatial distribution of these in Posses sub-basin, Extrema, representative of the Atlantic Forest biome present in southern Minas Gerais. For this, samples (0-0.20 m depth) were collected at 150 points, and their physical and chemical attributes were determined. Variables: Ca, Mg, K, P, pH, organic matter (MO), geometric mean diameter of aggregates (DMGcp), weighted mean diameter of aggregates (DMPcp) and flocculation index (IF) showed spatial dependence structure, which allowed mapping from geostatistical techniques. P, DMGsp and DMPsp presented structure with nugget effect, possibly due to an insufficient distance to capture spatial dependence in the sample for these attributes, and human interferences. The variation for Ca can be explained due to lime application, which occurred in some small properties located in the sub-basin. The DMGcp, DMPcp, and IF evaluated were adjusted in line with each other, indicating good soil aggregation.

abstract = {Legacy soil data have been produced over 70 years in nearly all countries of the world. Unfortunately, data, information and knowledge are still currently fragmented and at risk of getting lost if they remain in a paper format. To process this legacy data into consistent, spatially explicit and continuous global soil information, data are being rescued and compiled into databases. Thousands of soil survey reports and maps have been scanned and made available online. The soil profile data reported by these data sources have been captured and compiled into databases. The total number of soil profiles rescued in the selected countries is about 800,000. Currently, data for 117, 000 profiles are compiled and harmonized according to GlobalSoilMap specifications in a world level database (WoSIS). The results presented at the country level are likely to be an underestimate. The majority of soil data is still not rescued and this effort should be pursued. The data have been used to produce soil property maps. We discuss the pro and cons of top-down and bottom-up approaches to produce such maps and we stress their complementarity. We give examples of success stories. The first global soil property maps using rescued data were produced by a top-down approach and were released at a limited resolution of 1 km in 2014, followed by an update at a resolution of 250 m in 2017. By the end of 2020, we aim to deliver the first worldwide product that fully meets the GlobalSoilMap specifications.},

The present study aims at developing heuristic models, e.g. gene expression programming (GEP), neuro-fuzzy (NF), neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM) for modeling soil CEC using soil parameters. Soil characteristic data including soil physical parameters (e.g. silt, clay and sand content), organic carbon, and pH from two different sites in Iran were utilized to feed the applied heuristic models. The models were assessed through a k-fold test data set scanning procedures, so a complete scan of the possible train and test patterns was carried out at each site. Comparison of the models showed that the NF outperforms the other applied models in both studied sites. The obtained results revealed that the performance of the applied models fluctuated throughout the test stages and between two sites, so a reliable assessment of the model should consider a complete scan of the utilized data set, which will be a good option for preventing partially valid conclusions obtained from assessing the models based on a simple data set assignment.},

abstract = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) is a successful sub discipline of soil science with an active research output. The success of digital soil mapping is a confluence of several factors in the beginning of 2000 including the increased availability of spatial data (digital elevation model, satellite imagery), the availability of computing power for processing data, the development of data-mining tools and GIS, and numerous applications beyond geostatistics. In addition, there was an increased global demand for spatial data including uncertainty assessments, and a rejuvenation of many soil survey and university centres which helped in the spreading of digital soil mapping technologies and knowledge. The theoretical framework for digital soil mapping was formalised in a 2003 paper in Geoderma. In this paper, we define what constitutes digital soil mapping, sketch a brief history of it, and discuss some lessons. Digital soil mapping requires three components: the input in the form of field and laboratory observational methods, the process used in terms of spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, and the output in the form of spatial soil information systems, which includes outputs in the form of rasters of prediction along with the uncertainty of prediction. We also illustrate the history with a number of sleeping beauty papers that seem too precocious and consequently the ideas were not taken up by contemporaries and largely forgotten. It took another 30 to 40. years before the ideas were rediscovered and then flourished. Examples include proximal soil sensing that was developed in the 1920s, soil spectroscopy in 1970s, and soil mapping based on similarity of environmental factors in 1979. In summary, the coming together of emerging topics and timeliness greatly assists in the development of paradigm. We learned that research and ideas that are too precocious are largely ignored - such work warrants (re)discovery.},

Although a variety of DSM techniques have been developed and are widely available, it is important not to lose sight of the wealth of existing soils information captured by historic soil survey and soil scientists. This paper presents a DSM method that combines expert knowledge with fuzzy logic and selective soil sampling to generate soil class and property maps for an approximately 16-ha (?40-acre) farm field in southeastern Indiana. Five soil classes were produced by implementing a fuzzy membership based approach utilizing four digital elevation model (DEM) derived terrain attributes: SAGA topographic wetness index (TWI), modified catchment area (MCA), slope percentage, and elevation. From the fuzzy class membership values, in combination with selective soil sampling and model calibration, calibrated and uncalibrated loess depth maps were generated. The mean absolute error (MAE) of predicted loess depth was 27 cm for uncalibrated prediction and 29 cm for calibrated prediction. Normalized yield data from 2011 found all five soil classes differed significantly in yield, giving evidence the five classes function differently in crop production.},

@article{Hengl2013,
abstract = {This paper proposes two compound measures of mapping quality to support objective comparison of spatial prediction techniques for geostatistical mapping: (1) mapping efficiency - defined as the costs per area per amount of variation explained by the model, and (2) information production efficiency - defined as the cost per byte of effective information produced. These were inspired by concepts of complexity from mathematics and physics. Complexity i.e. the total effective information is defined as bytes remaining after compression and after rounding up the numbers using half the mapping accuracy (effective precision). It is postulated that the mapping efficiency, for an area of given size and limited budget, is basically a function of inspection intensity and mapping accuracy. Both measures are illustrated using the Meuse and Eberg{\"{o}}tzen case studies (gstat, plotKML packages). The results demonstrate that, for mapping organic matter (Meuse data set), there is a gain in the mapping efficiency when using regression-kriging versus ordinary kriging: mapping efficiency is 7{\%} better and the information production efficiency about 25{\%} better (3.99 vs 3.14 EUR B-1 for the GZIP compression algorithm). For mapping sand content (Eberg{\"{o}}tzen data set), the mapping efficiency for both ordinary kriging and regression-kriging is about the same; the information production efficiency is 29{\%} better for regression-kriging (37.1 vs 27.7 EUR B-1 for the GZIP compression algorithm). Information production efficiency is possibly a more robust measure of mapping quality than mapping efficiency because: (1) it is scale-independent, (2) it can be more easily related to the concept of effective information content, and (3) it accounts for the extrapolation effects. The limitation of deriving the information production efficiency is that both reliable estimate of the model uncertainty and the mapping accuracy is required. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Soil organic carbon also controls many beneficial properties such as fertility, aggregate stability and degradation of groundwater pollutants. Therefore mapping soil carbon at landscape scale is needed to define appropriate management that will favour higher soil quality. Actual soil carbon maps of France have a too coarse resolution, i.e. 8 and 12 km, to define efficient land management practices. Therefore, here, we model soil organic carbon in France at a resolution of 250 m. We study the impact of land use, soil type, climate and agro-management on soil organic carbon. We found that the total soil carbon stock in France is about 3.7 +/- 1.3 Pg. Results also show that the precipitation pattern dominates the overall spatial distribution of soil carbon. Land use is the most important factor controlling organic carbon changes at landscape scale. Our high resolution national map of soil organic C will be useful to define land management practices that will improve soil quality.},

Stratification by drainage classes did not have significant effect.

@article{Goovaerts2001,
abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of modelling the uncertainty about the value of continuous soil attributes, at any particular unsampled location (local uncertainty) as well as jointly over several locations (multiple-point or spatial uncertainty). Two approaches are presented: kriging-based and simulation-based techniques that can be implemented within a parametric (e.g. multi-Gaussian) or non-parametric (indicator) frameworks. As expected in theory and illustrated by case studies, the two approaches yield similar models of local uncertainty, yet the simulation-based approach has several advantages over kriging: (1) it provides a model of spatial uncertainty, e.g. the probability that a given threshold is exceeded jointly at several locations can be readily computed, (2) conditional cumulative distribution function (ccdf) for supports larger than the measurement support (e.g. remediation units or flow simulator cells) can be numerically approximated by the cumulative distribution of block simulated values that are obtained by averaging values simulated within the block, and (3) the set of realizations allows one to study the propagation of uncertainty through global GIS operations or complex transfer functions, such as flow simulators that consider many locations simultaneously rather than one at a time. The other issue is the evaluation of the quality or "goodness" of uncertainty models. Two new criteria (exceedence probability plot and narrowness of probability intervals that include the true values) are presented to assess the accuracy and precision of local uncertainty models using cross-validation. According to the second criterion, multi-Gaussian kriging performs better than indicator kriging for the hydraulic conductivity (HC) data set. However, looking at the distribution of flow simulator responses, sequential indicator simulation (sis) yields better results than sequential Gaussian simulation (sGs) that does not allow for significant correlation of extreme values (destructuration effect). ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Krotovinas, burrows of small mammals, occur widely in the soils of the steppes. The distribution and effect of krotovinas on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were studied in a deep profile (450 cm) at an archaeological site of the Palaeolithic period at Shenyang Agricultural University of China. It was found krotovinas occurred at all depths, and there was variation in their distribution and size. The density of krotovinas increased with depth, and was the highest (10/m2) at 250 cm depth. The average area of krotovinas' sections in most part of the profile ranged from 100 to 160 cm2. Krotovinas covered an area of 7 to 17{\%} of the profile wall. Average SOC concentration in the krotovinas was 5.3 g/kg, whereas it was 4.5 g/kg in the surrounding soil matrix. SOC stocks at 100 to 450 cm accounted for 72{\%} of total SOC stocks at 0 to 450 cm depth. Total SOC stock in the whole profile (0 to 450 cm) was 295 t/ha considering the presence of krotovinas, whereas it was 274 t/ha when the krotovinas were excluded. This study shows how krotovinas can be quantified, and that krotovinas can affect SOC concentration and change patterns of SOC distribution. The amount of SOC stored in deep soils should be taken into consideration for evaluating SOC stocks.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to evaluate the artificial neural networks and the maximum likelihood classification performances to classify land uses at Vi{\c{c}}osa, Minas Gerais State, using ASTER images in order to verify degradation levels of pastures. In this study, three different levels of pasture degradation have been identified (moderate, strong and very strong) and an image composition of 3 bands was tested (covering the visible and the near infra-red) with 15 m of spatial resolution. The neural networks simulator used was the “Neural Java Network Simulator”, with a feed forward model and the learning algorithm of back propagation. The obtained results show that the classification using neural networks, while presenting a slightly superior result, had a statistically similar performance compared to the maximum likelihood, getting a Kappa index of 0.80, against 0.79, respectively. In relation to individual performances, the class that presented the greatest error of classification was pasture in the level of very strong degradation, while the largest accuracy in the classification was obtained for coffee, for both classifiers, with 100 and 96{\%} (respectively, Maxver and neural networks).},

abstract = {This study refers to a semi-detailed soil survey in the watershed of the Bengala River, Cachoeiras de Macacu, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The objective was to characterize, classify and map soils in an area of 1991.89ha, according to slope and altitude, based on digital elevation model (DEM). The definition of the map units was done by using a planialtimetric map, DEM, and slope, associated with visual interpretation of ALOS images. For the fieldwork, a GSP was used for global positioning and data collection. Thirteen sites were sampled, with 10 complete profiles and 3 extra samples. The soils were evaluated for their morphological, physical and chemical properties. The soil classes identified in the area were: Red Latosol (Ferralsols; RL), Red Argisol (Lixisols; RA), Red-Yellow Latosol (Ferralsols; RYL), Yellow-Oxisol (Ferralsols; YL), Yellow Argisol (Lixisols; YA), Haplic Cambisol (Cambisols; HC), and Fluvic Neosol (Fluvisols; FN), They were distributed into 5 map units. The most representative units were HC (779.21ha) and RYL (587.47ha), which were relatively homogeneous in terms of soil properties. These two units were followed by associations of RL+RA and YL+YA, with a total of 425.94ha. The unit NF occurred in the floodplains and along the Bengala river bank with 201.31ha. The application of DEM associated with visual interpretation of the ALOS image enabled to reach a higher minimum mapping area without this tools and, thus, a more detailed survey. The semi-detailed survey proved to be an important step for inventories of land use, as well as for usage recommendation at the watershed level.},

@article{Rossiter2018,
abstract = {Although pedometric approaches were taken as early as 1925, the post-WWII development of information technology radically transformed the possibilities for applying mathematical methods to soil science. The most significant development is the digital computer and associated developments in computer science. These allowed statistical inference on large pedometric datasets, e.g., numerical taxonomy of soils from the early 1960s and geostatistics from the mid-1970s, as well as simulation models of soil processes. By the time of the first Pedometrics conference in 1992 sufficient computing power was available for stochastic simulation and complex geostatistical procedures such as disjunctive kriging. In the intervening 25 years computing power has grown to almost magical proportions, allowing individual scientists to carry out complex procedures. A second development is the growth of networking. This facilitates collaboration among pedometricians, rapid communication with journals, collaborative programming and publication, and easy access to resources. A third development is the availability of on-line storage of large datasets, especially of open data, including GIS coverages and remotely-sensed images. This allows pedometricians working on geographic problems to integrate sources from multiple disciplines, most notably in digital soil mapping using a wide variety of covariates related to soil genesis. It also promotes the an open-source movement of collaborative development of computer programs useful for pedometrics. A fourth development is the wide range of digital sensors which provide data for pedometrics; sensors include spectroscopy, electromagnetic induction, and {\$}\gamma{\$}-ray detectors., connected to each other and to central data stores. A fifth development is wireless technology, including mobile computing and telephony, again greatly facilitating rapid and extensive data collection – in pedometrics, the more dense the data, the greater the analytical possibilities and the lower the uncertainty. A final development is a global navigation satellite system (e.g., GPS), making accurate georeference of field data a routine part of data collection, and thereby assuring the highest possible accuracy in maps made by predictive pedometric methods. As computer power increases, models can be correspondingly detailed. As sensor networks and remote sensing provide ever more abundant and spatiotemporally fine-resolution measurements, the challenge is to manage this information and maintain the link with pedologic and soil-landscape knowledge, within the context of societal needs for the results of pedometric analysis.},

abstract = {Knowledge of soil properties with complete area coverage is needed for policy-making, land resource management, and monitoring environmental impacts. Remote sensing offers possibilities to support Digital Soil Mapping, especially in data-poor regions. The aim of this work was to test the potential of time-series of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation and drought indices to provide relevant information to model topsoil properties in a Boreal-Atlantic region (Scotland) focussing on differentiation between soils with high and soils with low organic matter contents. For each of the three considered years, 345 MODIS data sets were included in the exploratory analysis; 15 data products for 23 dates (bi-weekly) per year. Terrain parameters derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were also included. A methodology was implemented to exploit fully the high number of covariates, to identify the band, index or product that best correlates with the soil property of interest. In particular the proposed approach i. relies on freely globally available data-sets; ii. uses statistical criteria to select the combination of covariates providing the highest predictive capability, among the data considered and available; iii. deals with both continuous (using Generalized Additive Models, GAMs) and multinomial categorical (using Random Trees) types of variables; iv. takes into account fully the spatial autocorrelation of the data; v. provides estimates of the spatial uncertainty for each pixel; and vi. is computationally efficient when compared with methods such as forward stepwise. The models fitted show a fairly good agreement with existing data sets, presenting a consistent spatial pattern. The use of MODIS data as covariates increased the predictive capabilities of GAMs using only terrain parameters. The misclassification error for organic matter classes was between 25 and 35{\%}. The assessment provided of the spatial uncertainty of the modelled values can be used in further modelling and in the assessment of consequences of climate-change and trade-off in land use changes. This approach can contribute to improving our understanding and modelling of soil processes and function over large, and relatively sparsely sampled, areas of the world. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the most recent developments in the field of geostatistics and describes their application topsoil science. Geostatistics provides descriptive tools such as semivariograms to characterize the spatial pattern of continuous and categorical soil attributes. Various interpolation (kriging) techniques capitalize on the spatial correlation between observations to predict attribute values at unsampled locations using information related to one or several attributes. An important contribution of geostatistics is the assessment of the uncertainty about unsampled values, which usually takes the form of a map of the probability of exceeding critical values, such as regulatory thresholds in soil pollution or criteria for soil quality. This uncertainty assessment can be combined with expert knowledge for decision making such as delineation of contaminated areas where remedial measures should be taken or areas of good soil quality where specific management plans can be developed. Last, stochastic simulation allows one to generate several models (images) of the spatial distribution of soil attribute values, all of which are consistent with the information available. A given scenario (remediation process, land use policy) can be applied to the set of realizations, allowing the uncertainty: Of the response (remediation efficiency, soil productivity) to be assessed.},

For many regions in the world precise maps of soil properties are missing, but often sparsely sampled and discontinuous (legacy) soil data are available. Soil property data (response) can then be related by digital soil mapping (DSM) to spatially exhaustive environmental data that describe soil forming factors (covariates) to create spatially continuous maps. With air- and spaceborne remote sensing data and multi-scale terrain analysis large sets of covariates have become common.

A geoGAM models smooth nonlinear relations between responses and single covariates and combines these model terms additively. Residual spatial autocorrelation is captured by a smooth function of spatial coordinates and nonstationary effects are included by interactions between covariates and smooth spatial functions. The core of fully automated model building for geoGAM is componentwise gradient boosting. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}We illustrate the application of the geoGAM framework by using soil data from the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. We modelled effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) in forest topsoils as continuous response. For agricultural land we predicted the presence of waterlogged horizons in given soil depth layers as binary and drainage classes as ordinal responses. For the latter we used proportional odds geoGAM taking the ordering of the response properly into account. Fitted geoGAM contained only few covariates (7 to 17) selected from large sets (333 covariates for forests, 498 for agricultural land). Model sparsity allowed covariate interpretation by partial effects plots. Prediction intervals were computed by model-based bootstrapping for ECEC. Predictive performance of the fitted geoGAM, tested with independent validation data and specific skill scores (SS) for continuous, binary and ordinal responses, compared well with other studies that modelled similar soil properties. SS of 0.23 up to 0.53 (with SS{\&}thinsp;={\&}thinsp;1 for perfect predictions and SS{\&}thinsp;={\&}thinsp;0 for zero explained variance) were achieved depending on response and type of score. geoGAM combines efficient model building from large sets of covariates with ease of effect interpretation and therefore likely raises the acceptance of DSM products by end-users.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Includes index. This book introduces the concept of soil security and its five dimensions: Capability, Capital, Condition, Connectivity and Codification. These five dimensions make it possible to understand soil's role in delivering ecosystem services and to quantify soil resource by measuring, mapping, modeling and managing it. Each dimension refers to a specific aspect: contribution to global challenges (Capability), value of the soil (Capital), current state of the soil (Condition), how people are connected to the soil (Connectivity) and development of good policy (Codification). This book considers soil security as an integral part of meeting the ongoing challenge to maintain human health and secure our planet's sustainability. The concept of soil security helps to achieve the need to maintain and improve the world's soil for the purpose of producing food, fiber and freshwater, and contributing to energy and climate sustainability.

Unfortunately, these are either missing for many regions or are not available at the desired spatial resolution or down to required soil depth. Conventional soil map generation remains costly.

We evaluated six approaches for DSM in three study regions in Switzerland (Berne, Greifensee, ZH forest) by mapping effective soil depth available to plants (SD), pH, soil organic matter (SOM), effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), clay, silt, gravel content and bulk density for four soil layers (totalling 48 responses). Models were built from 300{\&}ndash;500 environmental covariates by selecting linear models by (1) grouped lasso and by an ad-hoc stepwise procedure for (2) robust external-drift kriging (EDK). For (3) geoadditive models we selected penalized smoothing spline terms by componentwise gradient boosting (geoGAM). We further used two tree-based methods: (4) boosted regression trees (BRT) and (5) Random Forest (RF). Lastly, we computed (6) weighted model averages (MA) from predictions obtained from methods 1{\&}ndash;5. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}Lasso, georob and geoGAM successfully selected strongly reduced sets of covariates (subsets of 3{\&}ndash;6{\&}thinsp;{\%} of all covariates). To automatically select a sparse trend model for EDK was however difficult, and the applied ad hoc procedure was computationally inefficient and over-fitted the data. Differences in predictive performance, tested on independent validation data, were mostly small and did not reveal a single best method for 48 responses. Nevertheless, RF was on average often best among methods 1{\&}ndash;5 (28 of 48 responses), but was outcompeted by MA for 14 of these 28 responses. RF tended to over-fit the data. Performance of BRT was slightly worse than RF. GeoGAM performed poorly on some responses and was only best for 7 of 48 responses. Predictive precision of lasso was intermediate. All models generally had small bias. Only the computationally very efficient lasso had slightly larger bias likely because it tended to under-fit the data. Summarizing, although differences were small, the frequencies of best and worst performance clearly favoured RF if a single method is applied MA if multiple prediction models can be developed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It also discusses ways of producing models of the land-surface, from sampling procedures to digital elevation model (DEM) gridding techniques. An extensive comparison of the methods used to derive first and second order derivatives from DEMs have been presented. Mathematical models of the land surface have their uses, but it can be dangerous to regard them as being universally applicable, or even as capturing the essence of a real land surface. Understanding the concept of the land surface and its specific properties is a first step toward successful geomorphometric analysis. Ignoring aspects, such as the correct definition of a reference vertical datum, the density and distribution of the initial height observations, and the accuracy of measurement, can lead to serious artefacts and inaccuracies in the outputs of geomorphometric analysis.},

abstract = {In the context of a growing demand of high-resolution spatial soil information for environmental planning and modeling, fast and accurate prediction methods are needed to provide high-quality digital soil maps. Thus, this study focuses on the development of a methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) that is able to spatially predict soil units. Within a test area in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), covering an area of about 600 km(2), a digital soil map was predicted. Based on feed-forward ANN with the resilient backpropagation learning algorithm, the optimal network topology was determined with one hidden layer and 15 to 30 cells depending on the soil unit to be predicted. To describe the occurrence of a soil unit and to train the ANN, 69 different terrain attributes, 53 geologic-petrographic units, and 3 types of land use were extracted from existing maps and databases. 80{\%} of the predicted soil units (n = 33) showed training errors (mean square error) of the ANN below 0.1, 43{\%} were even below 0.05. Validation returned a mean accuracy of over 92{\%} for the trained network outputs. Altogether, the presented methodology based on ANN and an extended digital terrainanalysis approach is time-saving and cost effective and provides remarkable results.},

abstract = {This paper compares three models that use soil type information from point observations and a soil map to map the topsoil organic matter content for the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands. The models differ in how the information on soil type is obtained: model 1 uses soil type as depicted on the soil map for calibration and prediction; model 2 uses soil type as observed in the field for calibration and soil type as depicted on the map for prediction; and model 3 uses observed soil type for calibration and a pedometric soil map with quantified uncertainty for prediction. Calibration of the trend on observed soil type resulted in a much stronger predictive relationship between soil organic matter content and soil type than calibration on mapped soil type. Validation with an independent probability sample showed that model 3 out-performed models 1 and 2 in terms of the mean squared error. However, model 3 over-estimated the prediction error variance and so was too pessimistic about prediction accuracy. Model 2 performed the worst: it had the largest mean squared error and the prediction error variance was strongly under-estimated. Thus validation confirmed that calibration on observed soil type is only valid when the uncertainty about soil type at prediction sites is explicitly accounted for by the model. We conclude that whenever information about the uncertainty of the soil map is available and both soil property and soil type are observed at sampling sites, model 3 can be an improvement over the conventional model 1.},

abstract = {The 1:50,000 national soil survey of the Netherlands, completed in the early 1990s after more than three decades of mapping, is gradually becoming outdated. Large-scale changes in land and water management that took place after the field surveys have had a great impact on the soil. Especially oxidation of peat soils has resulted in a substantial decline of these soils. The aim of this research was to update the national soil map for the province of Drenthe (2680 km2) without additional fieldwork through digital soil mapping using legacy soil data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between ancillary variables and soil group. Special attention was given to model-building as this is perhaps the most crucial step in digital soil mapping. A framework for building a logistic regression model was taken from the literature and adapted for the purpose of soil mapping. The model-building process was guided by pedological expert knowledge to ensure that the final regression model is not only statistically sound but also pedologically plausible. We built separate models for the ten major map units, representing the main soil groups, of the national soil map for the province of Drenthe. The calibrated models were used to estimate the probability of occurrence of soil groups on a 25 m grid. Shannon entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of the updated soil map, and the updated soil map was validated by an independent probability sample. The theoretical purity of the updated map was 67{\%}. The estimated actual purity of the updated map, as assessed by the validation sample, was 58{\%}, which is 6{\%} larger than the actual purity of the national soil map. The discrepancy between theoretical and actual purity might be explained by the spatial clustering of the soil profile observations used to calibrate the multinomial logistic regression models and by the age difference between calibration and validation observations.},

abstract = {Includes index. This book introduces the concept of soil security and its five dimensions: Capability, Capital, Condition, Connectivity and Codification. These five dimensions make it possible to understand soil's role in delivering ecosystem services and to quantify soil resource by measuring, mapping, modeling and managing it. Each dimension refers to a specific aspect: contribution to global challenges (Capability), value of the soil (Capital), current state of the soil (Condition), how people are connected to the soil (Connectivity) and development of good policy (Codification). This book considers soil security as an integral part of meeting the ongoing challenge to maintain human health and secure our planet's sustainability. The concept of soil security helps to achieve the need to maintain and improve the world's soil for the purpose of producing food, fiber and freshwater, and contributing to energy and climate sustainability.

abstract = {The development of a strategy to reach soil data through vegetation has the potential to improve soil mapping in large areas covered by forests. This study aimed to develop a strategy to identify the relationship between soil information, such as texture, fertility and pedological classes, through vegetation spectral sensing obtained by a satellite sensor. The study area is located in Angola, Africa, covering 20,000 ha. Landsat images corresponding to dry and wet seasons were obtained, atmospheric corrected and transformed into reflectance. We built a mechanism to extract soil information and keep only vegetated areas in images. Afterward, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated and its pixel was linked with soil samples collected in the field (450 points at four depths, A: 0–0.2; B: 0.4–0.6; C: 0.8–1.0; D: 1.0–1.2 m), and the wet analysis was performed. The non-parametric tests were used to verify the NDVI variation according to soil classes and Landsat image acquisition date. Higher correlation values were obtained in the images from 2008, for Al saturation, Al content, and base saturation. Overall, soil attributes best related with vegetation were the ones directly or indirectly involved with Al. The best correlation occurred in the wet season, because vegetation expressed better its relation with soils and water availability. This relation did not vary much at depth. The higher Al content was associated with the development of vegetation adapted to this condition, i.e. a native savanna-type usually occurring in regions of dystrophic soils such as Ferralsols, which presented the highest NDVI mean and were statistically different from the other soil groups. Pedological classes drive water dynamics, which interferes on vegetation. Thus, we found an important relationship between NDVI and soil classes. Depending on the season, soil class varies on the NDVI projection, due to its morphological and attributes configuration. Thus, we conclude that only one soil attribute is not sufficient to drive the NDVI result, but it has to be combined with the soil class. Wet season is indicated as the best period to analyze vegetation in order to reach soil information. The results indicate an important strategy to assist digital soil mapping in vegetated areas.},

abstract = {This report evidences factors controlling soil organic carbon at the national scale by modelling data of 2,158 soil samples from France. The global soil carbon amount, of about 1,500 Gt C, is approximately twice the amount of atmosphere C. Therefore, soil has major impact on atmospheric CO2, and, in turn, climate change. Soil organic carbon further controls many soil properties such as fertility, water retention and aggregate stability. Nonetheless, precise mechanisms ruling interactions between soil organic carbon and environmental factors are not well known at the large scale. Indeed, most soil investigations have been conducted at the plot scale using a limited number of factors. Therefore, a national soil survey of 2,158 soil samples from France was carried out to measure soil properties such as texture, organic carbon, nitrogen and heavy metal content. Here, we studied factors controlling soil organic carbon at the national scale using a model based on stepwise linear regression. Factors analysed were land use, soil texture, rock fragment content, climate and land management. We used several criteria for model selection, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the corrected AIC rule and the Bayesian information criterion. Results show that organic carbon concentrations in fine earth increase with increasing rock fragment content, depending on land use and texture. Spreading farmyard manure and slurry induces higher carbon concentrations mostly in wet and stony grasslands. Nonetheless, a negative correlation has been found between carbon and direct C input from animal excrements on grasslands. Our findings will therefore help to define better land management practices to sequester soil carbon.},

abstract = {In low relief areas such as plains, easily obtained soil forming factors generally do not co-vary with soil conditions over space to the level that they can be used effectively in digital soil mapping. Mapping variation of soil properties over such areas remains a challenge. This paper presents an approach to mapping soil texture using environmental covariates derived from temporal responses of the land surface to a rainfall event (dynamic feedbacks) collected through remote sensing techniques. The approach consists of four steps: (1) construction of a set of environmental covariates from dynamic feedbacks of the land surface, captured daily from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images over a short period (6-7. days) after a major rain event; (2) derivation of environmental classes based on the set of environmental covariates using a fuzzy c-means clustering; (3) Identification of typical soil texture value for each of the environmental classes from a dataset of field soil samples; (4) mapping of spatial variation of soil texture through a linearly weighted averaging function. The approach was applied to produce soil texture maps in a low relief area situated in south-central Manitoba, Canada. Its performance was assessed through comparison with soil texture maps generated from 1:20,000 traditional soil survey. The assessment was based on 34 field sample sites, independent of the samples used for prediction. The error values (9.42 for MAE and 12.56 for RMSE) of A-horizon percentage of sand from the proposed approach are less than these from the detailed soil survey (10.59 for MAE and 15.12 for RMSE). Similar results were obtained for A-horizon percentage of clay. In addition, the difference between the results of multiple linear regression analysis without and with the MODIS derived variables further demonstrated the effectiveness of the variables at differentiating patterns of soil texture. These indicated that the proposed approach is effective for mapping the variation of soil texture over the low relief area and it could be used to map other soil property variation over similar areas. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Spatial predictions of soil macro and micro-nutrient content across Sub-Saharan Africa at 250 m spatial resolution and for 0–30 cm depth interval are presented. Predictions were produced for 15 target nutrients: organic carbon (C) and total (organic) nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), and extractable—phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al) and boron (B). Model training was performed using soil samples from ca. 59,000 locations (a compilation of soil samples from the AfSIS, EthioSIS, One Acre Fund, VitalSigns and legacy soil data) and an extensive stack of remote sensing covariates in addition to landform, lithologic and land cover maps. An ensemble model was then created for each nutrient from two machine learning algorithms—random forest and gradient boosting, as implemented in R packages ranger and xgboost—and then used to generate predictions in a fully-optimized computing system. Cross-validation revealed that apart from S, P and B, significant models can be produced for most targeted nutrients (R-square between 40–85{\%}). Further comparison with OFRA field trial database shows that soil nutrients are indeed critical for agricultural development, with Mn, Zn, Al, B and Na, appearing as the most important nutrients for predicting crop yield. A limiting factor for mapping nutrients using the existing point data in Africa appears to be (1) the high spatial clustering of sampling locations, and (2) missing more detailed parent material/geological maps. Logical steps towards improving prediction accuracies include: further collection of input (training) point samples, further harmonization of measurement methods, addition of more detailed covariates specific to Africa, and implementation of a full spatio-temporal statistical modeling framework.},

abstract = {Evaluating the accuracy of allocation to classes in monothetic hierarchical soil classification systems, including the World Reference Base for Soil Classification, US Soil Taxonomy, and Chinese Soil Taxonomy, is poorly-served by binomial methods (correct/incorrect allocation per evaluation observation), since some errors are more serious than others in terms of soil properties, map use, pedogenesis, and ease of mapping. Instead, evaluations should account for the taxonomic distance between classes, expressed as class similarities, giving partial credit to some incorrect allocations. These can then be used in weighted accuracy measures, either direct measures of agreement or measures that account for chance agreement, such as the tau index. Similarities can be determined in one of four ways: (1) by the expert opinion of a soil classification specialist; (2) by the distance between classes in a numerical taxonomy assessment; (3) by distance within a taxonomic hierarchy; or (4) by an error loss function. Expert opinion can be from the point of view of the map user, to assess map utility, or map producer, to assess mapping skill. Examples are given of determining similarity between a subset of Chinese Soil Taxonomy classes by expert opinion and by numerical taxonomy from soil spectra, and then using these for weighted accuracy assessment. A method for assessing the accuracy of probabilistic predictions of several classes at a location is also proposed.},

abstract = {Nowadays there is an increasing effort for raising global awareness for the importance of soils to ensure food security, to improve agricultural and environmental planning and monitoring, and to establish effective and sustainable land management policies to counteract soil degradation. This study presents the INFOSOLO legacy database as the first effort to develop a soil information system in Portugal, suitable to compile soil data produced in the country, and to support stakeholders and land managers in decision-making. The database currently includes soil data from a set of 9934 horizons/layers studied in 3461 soil profiles across the country between 1966 and 2014. Data was extracted from scattered soil surveys, research projects, and academic studies carried out by public Portuguese and other European institutions, with a series of validation tests and harmonization procedures being implemented in order to access and improve the quality of the data. The importance of the INFOSOLO legacy dataset was discussed and exemplified with the analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of selected soil properties, namely the organic carbon content, pH, and cation exchange capacity. For these properties, 1 km grid maps were also developed for the topsoil horizons/layers in Portugal using different spatial modelling approaches. To highlight the importance of using INFOSOLO for soil characterization, the EU-wide soil database LUCAS was used to compare both datasets in terms of data distributions, spatial continuity and accuracy of modelling outputs. The comparison also included the digital soil maps provided by the SoilGrids product for Portugal. The comparison results highlighted specific areas in the country for which INFOSOLO is capable to deliver accurate but also more reliable predictions when compared with the LUCAS and SoilGrids results. Thus, INFOSOLO provides the basis for improving soil information in the country and for raising national awareness of the importance of soil resources to the country's development.},

This paper demonstrates how the standard stochastic theory of error propagation can be extended and applied to continuously differentiable arithmetic operations (quantitative models) for manipulating gridded map data. The statistical methods have been programmed using the Taylor series expansion to approximate the models. Model inputs are (a) model coefficients and their standard errors and (b) maps of continuous variables and the associated prediction errors, which can be obtained by optimal interpolation from point data. The model output is a map that is accompanied by a map of prediction errors. The relative contributions of the errors in the inputs (model coefficients, maps of individual variables) can be determined and mapped separately allowing judgments to be made about subsequent survey optimization. The methods are illustrated by two case studies.},

abstract = {Potassium (K) is a crucial element for plant nutrition and its availability and spatial distribution in agricultural soils is influenced by many agro-environmental factors. In Switzerland, a soil monitoring network (FRIBO) was established in 1987 with 250 sites distributed over the whole of the canton of Fribourg (representing 4{\%} of the surface area of Switzerland), whose territory is shared between the Swiss Midlands and the Western Alp foothills. In this study area, diverse geological deposits (sandstone, marlstone, silts and calcareous rocks), soil types (Cambisols, Gleysols, Rendzinas, Luvisols and Fluvisols) and land uses (cropland, permanent grassland and mountain pasture) are present, making the network interesting for assessing the relative contribution of environmental variables and land use management on soil properties. The aims of the present study were to (i) characterize the soil K status in the Fribourg canton according to four different extraction methods; (ii) analyse the spatial variability of soil K in relation to land use, soil type, soil parent material and topography; (iii) evaluate the spatial predictability of K at the canton level; and (iv) analyse the implications for K fertilization management. The overall amount of soil total K averaged 13.6 g{\textperiodcentered}kg− 1with significant variations across the sites (5.1–22.1 g{\textperiodcentered}kg− 1). The spatial distribution of total K content was influenced by relatively extended soil forming processes, as suggested by (i) a significant global spatial autocorrelation measure at the 10 km scale (Moran's I = 0.43); (ii) significant differences observed among soil types and soil parent materials and (iii) significant correlations with land attributes such as elevation (r = − 0.51). On the other hand, available mean K forms were significantly different among land uses, with the highest mean values of available K encountered in permanent grasslands, from 46.3 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg− 1(water extraction) to 198 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg− 1(acetate ammonium + EDTA extraction). All K forms (total and available) showed similar spatial regional patterns for all spatial interpolation methods, with areas dominated by permanent grassland and crops presenting higher values. However, these trends were less pronounced for the available K forms due to the prevalence of on-farm management practices for these K forms (e.g. fertilization), likely inducing high spatial and temporal variability. This hypothesis was supported by spatial clustering of low and/or high K fertility status that could be related to local particular farming practices. Grasslands require particular attention with regard to overall high K fertility status.},

abstract = {Effective soil management requires knowledge of the spatial patterns
of soil variation within the landscape to enable wise land use decisions.
This is typically obtained through time-consuming and costly surveys.
The aim of this study was to develop a cost-efficient methodology
for digital soil mapping in poorly-accessible areas. The methodology
uses a spatial model calibrated on the basis of limited soil sampling
and explanatory covariables related to soil-forming factors, developed
from readily available secondary information from accessible areas.
The model is subsequently applied in the poorly-accessible areas.
This can only be done if the environmental conditions in the poorly-accessible
areas are also found in the accessible areas in which the model is
developed. This study illustrates the methodology in an exercise
to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in the Limpopo
National Park, Mozambique. Readily-available secondary data was used
as explanatory variables representing the soil-forming factors. Conditions
in the accessible and poorly-accessible areas corresponded sufficiently
to allow the extrapolation of the spatial model into the latter.
The spatial variation of SOC in the accessible area was mostly described
by the sampling cluster (71.5{\%}) and the landscape unit (46.3{\%}). Therefore
ordinary (punctual) kriging (OK) and kriging with external drift
(KED) based on the landscape unit were used to predict SOC. A linear
regression (LM) model using only landscape stratification was used
as control. All models were independently validated with test sets
collected in both accessible and poorly-accessible areas. In the
former the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.42–0.50{\%}
SOC. The ratio between the RMSEP in the poorly-accessible and accessible
areas was 0.67–0.72, showing that the methodology can be applied
to predict SOC in poorly-accessible areas as successful as in accessible
areas. The methodology is thus recommended for areas with similar
access problems, especially for baseline studies and for sample design
in two-stage surveys.},

The results showed that the wavelet components strengthened soil-landscape relationships in terms of correlation coefficients, enhanced soil-landscape modelling in terms of MLR modelling coefficients of determination (R2). Compared with several standard DSM approaches, i.e., ordinary kriging (OK), MLR and RK with the original terrain attributes, the use of wavelet components improved the prediction accuracy at some scales, but not all the scales. Most of the improvements were at the slight to moderate levels, e.g., 3.66–14.24{\%} increases in the accuracy based on mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error and R2. Maps made with wavelet components were relatively smooth and sometimes contained hotspots due to characteristics of wavelet components, which differed a lot from those made by the standard DSM methods. The potential benefits of using wavelet components as predictors in DSM may be further revealed in the future when more predictor selection approaches and mapping methods are considered.},

The high dimensionality and grouped nature of this type of data can complicate standard analysis, summarization, and visualization. The "aqp" (algorithms for quantitative pedology) package was designed to support data-driven approaches to common soils-related tasks such as visualization, aggregation, and classification of soil profile collections. In addition, we sought to advance the study of numerical soil classification by building on previously published methods within an extensible and open source framework. Functions in the aqp package have been successfully applied to studies involving several thousand soil profiles.

This drives the worldwide development of digital soil mapping. In recent years, significant progresses have been made in different aspects of digital soil mapping. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review for the major progresses of digital soil mapping in the last decade. First, we briefly described the rise of digital soil mapping and outlined important milestones and their influence, and main paradigms in digital soil mapping. Then, we reviewed the progresses in legacy soil data, environmental covariates, soil sampling, predictive models and the applications of digital soil mapping products. Finally, we summarized the main trends and future prospect as revealed by studies up to now. We concluded that although the digital soil mapping is now moving towards mature to meet various demands of soil information, challenges including new theories, methodologies and applications of digital soil mapping, especially for highly heterogeneous and human-affected environments, still exist and need to be addressed in the future.},

abstract = {Pedological surveys and physiographic characterization of a watershed are fundamental procedures for planning the soil use. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize and map the soil classes of the Lajeado Pessegueiro watershed, located in Guaruj{\'{a}} do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The types of land use and occupation, slope classes and physiography of the study area were delineated and described. Data were collected from 19 complete soil profiles and 9 extra samples. Physiographic analysis was performed using prior information on the photopedology of the terrain geomorphological characteristics, climatic conditions, vegetation, land use and geological conditions. The watershed has a predominant undulating relief (406.51 ha). The predominant land use is agricultural, with temporary annual crops (50.09{\%}). The predominant physiography is colluvial erosional slope (35.53{\%}), followed by erosional slope (27.13{\%}), plateau slope (21.55{\%}), alluvial colluvial valley bottom (10.51{\%}) and erosional colluvial slope (5.23{\%}). The soil classes found were Red Nitosols (37.54{\%}), Haplic Nitosols (8.22{\%}), Haplic Cambisols (35.20{\%}), Fluvic Cambisols (3.92{\%}), Red Argisols (10.09{\%}) and Litholic Neosols (5.04{\%}). The data showed the importance of using the physiographic analysis of the area with geoprocessing techniques, assisting pedological surveys with presentation through thematic maps. These maps serve as a base material in studies evaluating land uses, and those aiming to contribute to a better planning of soil use.},

abstract = {A soil survey is the main source of soil spatial information and is very useful in supporting land use decisions, especially for agronomic purposes. However, the continuity of soil surveying in Brazil has been compromised due the minimal amount of government investment in the sector. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of three data mining methods-decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN)-with R software to predict soil map units from the Guapi-Macacu watershed in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), remote sensing data (Landsat 5), and a geology map were used as predictors. Evaluation of the models' performance was based on statistical indices obtained from a confusion matrix by using validation samples. Furthermore, a comparison was performed to analyze the agreement between the maps created from the models and from a conventional soil map (legacy data); sampling locations were not used as input data in the training process. The results indicated better performance from the RF model compared with the DT and ANN models. The accuracy was calculated through validation samples indicating values in the Kappa index corresponding to 0.76 (RF), 0.72 (ANN) and 0.66 (DT). A comparison between the maps obtained from the models and the conventional soil map exhibited better agreement with the RF model (68.7{\%}), followed by the ANN (62.8{\%}), and DT (62.3{\%}) models. The classification accuracy, obtained through comparisons with sampling locations, exhibited correct classification of 57.6{\%} in the RF model, 56.8{\%} in the DT, and 56.1{\%} in the ANN model; the conventional soil map had 69.7{\%} correct classification. In general, most of the confusion between soil map units was observed in Haplic Gleysols, Haplic Acrisols (Clayic) and Fluvisols. In terms of covariates importance, in general, the terrain attributes derived from the DEM had more influence as predictor covariates than the indices obtained from the Landsat data. The application of data mining can improve the methods applied to soil map units, thereby contributing to increasing information related to soil-landscape relationships and enhancing the products of soil surveys.},

abstract = {Soil information is essential for sustainable management of ecosystems. In many parts of Iran, soil information is either not available or difficult to obtain. Therefore, when no detailed map or soil information is accessible in a region of interest, one way to obtain information is to extrapolate information from other parts having soil information. This study was conducted to determine whether - machine-learning extrapolation method extracted from the reference region, i.e. Zarand can estimate soil classes in the interest region, i.e. Bam and reduce the costs of soil mapping. To identify similarities between reference and interest regions, homology of soil forming factors was determined using Gower's similarity index. Then, the multinomial logistic regression was extracted from the reference region and applied into the interest region to estimate soil classes. Moreover, soil classes were predicted in the interest region using direct soil observations; finally, the accuracy of the soil maps obtained from both methods was assessed. Based on Gower index, the study regions, namely Bam and Zarand, were to some extent similar in term of soil forming factors. The results showed that although the soil map derived from the extrapolation process indicated appropriate spatial coverage of soil classes in the interest area, the resultant predictive map of calibrated-in process was slightly more accurate, i.e. higher $\kappa$, lower Brier scores. Acceptable levels of predictive accuracy (60{\%}) were achieved using extrapolated model while costs simultaneously significantly lowered. This study put forward the view that the extrapolation method was quite useful in predicting soil classes within areas where soil mapping by calibrated-in method might be too costly or time consuming or where soil observations may not be sufficient. Nevertheless, this research encouraged us to use extrapolated method to fill the gaps in the present soil map of Iran and to apply it as the base map to increase and improve the efficiency of digital soil mapping.},

abstract = {The concept of soil security has been proposed with the dimensions of capability, condition, capital, connectivity, and codification of soil. However, it remains a challenge to accurately and efficiently assess the soil's capability and condition as a function of soil change. The idea of genoform and phenoform was proposed 20 years ago and recently revitalized. Herein, we were inspired by these concepts to develop a general approach and concepts of genosoils and phenosoils for distinguishing the soil changes within soil mapping units as affected by human activities. Across a 220 km2district with a diversity in landforms, parent materials, and land use types, we generated maps of Pre-European (soil classes that existed prior to agricultural development) soil classes using a digital soil mapping approach. Based on the land use change, Pre-European genosoils and present genosoils and phenosoils were identified and mapped within each of the Pre-European soil classes. The measured topsoil (0–10 cm) and subsoil (40–50 cm) properties have shown differences between the present genosoils and phenosoils. By objectively calculating the distances between the present genosoils and phenosoils in a principal component space using a recently published comprehensive soil classification system, several present phenosoils displayed significant differences among several soil properties (distance {\textgreater}8{\%} of overall distance) and were redefined as new genosoils. The approach has successfully mapped genosoils and phenosoils within Pre-European soil classes at the district scale and identified shifts between present genosoils and phenosoils. It showed potential in detecting areas of soil changes due to human activities. Future work is required to separate seasonal fluctuations from long-term variations in NDVI and improve land use classification using remote sensing data. The method developed here can be applied in areas without remnant vegetation to separate the soil condition from capability by gauging phenosoils against genosoils.},

abstract = {Soil is recognized as the largest carbon reservoir in the terrestrial ecosystem. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is vulnerable to changes in land use and climate. For a better understanding of the SOC dynamics and its driving factors, we collected data of the 1980s and 2000s in the North and Northeast China and conducted the digital soil mapping for spatial variation of SOC for the respective period. In the 1980s, 585 soils were sampled and the area was resampled in 2003 and 2004 (1062 samples) in a 30-km grid. The main land use in the area was cropland, forest and grassland. The random forest was used to predict the SOC concentration and its temporal change using land use, terrain factors, vegetation index, vis-NIR spectra and climate factors as predictors. The average SOC concentration in 1985 was 10.0 g kg−1compared to 12.5 g kg−1in 2004. The SOC variation was similar over the two periods, and levels increased from south to north. The estimated SOC stock was 1.68 Pg in 1985 and 1.66 Pg in 2004, but the SOC changes were different under different land uses. Over the twenty-year period, average temperatures increased and large areas of forests and grassland were converted to cropland. SOC under cropland was increased by 0.094 Pg (+9{\%}) whereas 0.089 Pg SOC was lost under forests (−25{\%}) and 0.037 Pg in the soils under grassland (−25{\%}). It is concluded that land use is the main drivers for SOC changes in this area while climate change had different contributions in different regions. SOC loss was remarkable under the land use conversion while cropland has considerable potential to sequester SOC.},

abstract = {This study aimed to use spatial uncertainty of magnetic susceptibility (MS) and clay content to improve soil-mapping units. In an experimental area of 870 ha, a regular sampling grid containing 371 points was set, in which MS and clay content were assessed at a depth range of 0–0.25 m. Using a digital elevation model and field observations, a 4440-m transect was established on the study area from hilltop to the foothill, toward the gentlest slope. Standard deviation maps based on 200 realizations of the sequential gaussian simulation measured spatial estimate uncertainties. To limit transition zones along the transect, uncertainty isolines representative of the transition between soil-mapping units were selected. Both attributes presented peaks of uncertainties near the change of mapping units, previously known. Uncertainty zones, previously delineated, ranged from 45 to 210 m and from 60 to 170 m, for MS and clay content, respectively. However, after extrapolating the uncertainties to the side of the transect, amplitude changes of the uncertainty zones were observed, especially in the transition regions between landscape shape and geology. Delineation of mapping units, which incorporated the uncertainties of MS and clay content, was similar. However, due to lower cost and promptness, MS becomes the most feasible alternative. Knowing spatial uncertainties enables readjusting limits in maps of soil-mapping units and may support identification of most favorable regions for determining modal pedon representative of each unit.},

The main objective of this study was to answer this question. A set of 339 soil samples from a small slope catchment in Southern Brazil was used to build PMs of psd in the surface soil layer. Multiple linear regression models were constructed using terrain attributes (elevation, slope, catchment area, convergence index, and topographic wetness index). The PMs explained more than half of the data variance. This performance is similar to (or even better than) that of the conventional soil mapping approach. For some size fractions, the PM performance can reach 70 {\%}. Largest uncertainties were observed in geologically more complex areas. Therefore, significant improvements in the predictions can only be achieved if accurate geological data is made available. Meanwhile, PMs built on terrain attributes are efficient in predicting the particle-size distribution (psd) of soils in regions of complex geology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Traditional soil maps have helped us to better understand soil, to form our concepts and to teach and transfer our ideas about it, and so they have been used for many purposes. Although, soil maps are available in many countries, there is a need for them to be updated because they are often deficient in that their spatial delineations and their descriptions are subjective and lack assessments of uncertainty. Updating them is a priority for federal soil surveys worldwide as well as for research, teaching and communication. New data from sensors and quantitative ‘digital' methods provide us with the tools to do so. Here, we present an approach to update large scale, national soil maps with data derived from a combination of traditional soil profile classifications, classifications made with visible–near infrared (vis–NIR) spectroscopy, and digital soil class mapping (DSM). Our results present an update of the Australian Soil Classification (ASC) orders map. The overall error rate of the DSM model, tested on an independent validation set, was 55.6{\%}, and a few of the orders were poorly classified. We discuss the possible reasons for these errors, but argue that compared to the previous ASC maps, our classification was derived objectively, using currently best available data sets and methods, the classification model was interpretable in terms of the factors of soil formation, the modelling produced a 1 × 1 km resolution soil map with estimates of spatial uncertainty for each soil order and our map has no artefacts at state and territory borders.},

abstract = {The objective of the work presented in this paper was to investigate how rasters of the probabilities of occurrence of soil classes may be used to create digital soil property maps and maps of their associated uncertainties. The approach we present is formalised in an algorithm we developed called “Digital Soil Property Mapping Using Soil Class Probability Rasters” (PROPR). The soil class probability rasters were derived previously from a spatial disaggregation of the 1:250,000-scale Dalrymple Shire legacy soil polygon map from central Queensland, Australia. We created digital soil property maps of soil pH1:5 H2O and their uncertainties (as indicated by estimates of the limits of the 90{\%} prediction interval) at six depth increments down the soil profile (0–5cm, 5–15cm, 15–30cm, 30–60cm, 60–100cm, 100–200cm). The calculation of the weighted mean soil pH value for each depth increment at each grid cell was based on reference pH values for each soil class and used the probabilities of occurrence at each grid cell as weights. The calculation of the prediction interval limits for each depth increment involved sampling from the triangular distribution of the soil pH of each soil class using the soil class probabilities at each grid cell as weights in order to identify the number of samples to draw from each distribution. The 90{\%} prediction interval limits were then estimated as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of samples drawn from the soil classes' triangular distributions. The maps of soil pH displayed strong spatial patterns. Soil pH generally increased with depth. Uncertainty generally increased with depth. Validation on 300 randomly-selected soil profiles returned a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.193 at the surface increasing to 0.266 at depth. RMSE increased with depth from about 0.75pH units at the surface to 1.15 at depth. Soil class probability rasters are useful for generating digital soil property maps and maps of the associated uncertainties. Validation left room for improvement but the quality of the results is probably strongly affected by the quality of the spatial disaggregation that produced the soil class probability rasters. The PROPR approach may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. Generation of the soil class probability rasters to use in PROPR is a predictive exercise in itself and so is also subject to uncertainty. The probability rasters likely can be derived by several methods including logistic regression and data mining; the probability rasters we used were derived via spatial disaggregation of a legacy soil polygon map. PROPR may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. The soil class probability rasters need to be produced separately. Information on the within-soil-class variability of the target soil property at each depth increment must be known in order to establish the triangular distributions for the uncertainty estimation. PROPR may reduce reliance on having sufficient soil profile observations in areas where such data is limiting. We used available profile observations to estimate the within-soil-class variability in order to establish triangular distributions for the soil classes in our study area, but the information required to do so could also be derived from legacy reports or expert knowledge.},

abstract = {A novel method for soil carbon auditing at farm scale based on data value is presented. Using a map of carbon content with associated uncertainty, it optimizes stratified random sampling: number of strata, stratum boundaries, total sample size and sample sizes within strata. The optimization maximizes the expected profit for the farmer on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. The stratification is optimized by a novel method (. Ospats), an iterative procedure that re-allocates grid points to strata on the basis of pairwise differences between predictions and covariances of prediction errors. Optimal sample sizes are calculated from variance predictions by Ospats. An application on an Australian farm has shown that soil carbon changes across farms and regions can be audited effectively using the proposed method. It is concluded that sample bulking and returning to the same sites in subsequent sampling rounds are not recommendable.},

Several soil properties were predicted using hybrid approaches like regression kriging. In this paper we describe the prediction of topsoil texture and related derived physical properties. Regression models were fitted using, along other variables, remotely sensed data coming from the MODIS sensor. The high temporal resolution of MODIS allowed detecting changes in the vegetative response due to soil properties, which can then be used to map soil features distribution. We will also discuss the prediction of intrinsically collinear variables like soil texture which required the use of models capable of dealing with multivariate constrained dependent variables like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).Cross validation of the fitted models proved that the LUCAS dataset constitutes a good sample for mapping purposes leading to cross-validation R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}between 0.47 and 0.50 for soil texture and normalized errors between 4 and 10{\%}.},

Profiles have been described, sampled, and analysed according to methods and standards in use in the originating countries; analytical results for the same property cannot always be compared directly; as a result the amount of measured data available for modelling is sometimes much less than expected.

abstract = {A geostatistical model was developed and applied to predict six soil properties and soil horizon thickness for mineral A, B and C soil horizons at the European scale and quantify the associated prediction uncertainties. The soil properties are pH, organic carbon content, organic nitrogen content, clay and sand contents and bulk density. The geostatistical model takes a regression cokriging approach, in which correlations between soil properties and across soil horizons are taken into account. Non-stationarities in the means and variances are represented by mapping units of the generalised European soil and land cover maps. The model was calibrated using the combined WISE, SPADE 1 and EFSDB databases, which jointly contain approximately 3600 soil profiles, irregularly distributed over Europe. The resulting model showed for most soil properties strong dependencies on soil type and land cover, moderate correlations between soil property residuals, strong correlations across horizons, and moderate spatial correlation of regression residuals. Kriging predictions and simulations were made on a 5km by 5km grid. Uncertainties in the resulting maps are large, particularly in under-sampled parts of Europe and in strata with large spatial variation. We conclude that geostatistical prediction and simulation are useful techniques to quantify uncertainties in soil property maps at the European scale, but that many more observations are required to fully exploit the relationship with explanatory variables and improve mapping accuracy. One important advantage of the techniques used is that they yield a full probabilistic model, as required by Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation analyses of spatially distributed dynamic models that use soil properties as uncertain input. In particular, the results of this study have been used to analyse how uncertainty in soil properties propagate through terrestrial greenhouse gas emission models.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of soil carbon is essential for accounting carbon cycling on the background of global environment change. However, previous studies made little contribution to the patterns and stocks of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in large scales. In this study, we defined the structure of the soil depth function to fit vertical distribution of SIC based on pedogenic knowledge across various landscapes. Soil depth functions were constructed from a dataset of 99 soil profiles in the alpine area of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The parameters of depth functions were mapped from environmental covariates using random forest. Finally, SIC stocks at three depth intervals in the upper 1 m depth were mapped across the entire study area by applying predicted soil depth functions at each location. The results showed that the soil depth functions were able to improve accuracy for fitting the vertical distribution of the SIC content, with a mean determination coefficient of R2 = 0.93. Overall accuracy for predicted SIC stocks was assessed on training samples. High Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values (0.84–0.86) indicate that predicted and observed values were in good agreement (RMSE: 1.52–1.67 kg m− 2 and ME: − 0.33 to − 0.29 kg m− 2). Variable importance showed that geographic position predictors (longitude, latitude) were key factors predicting the distribution of SIC. Terrain covariates were important variables influencing the three-dimensional distribution of SIC in mountain areas. By applying the proposed approach, the total SIC stock in this area is estimated at 75.41 Tg in the upper 30 cm, 113.15 Tg in the upper 50 cm and 190.30 Tg in the upper 1 m. We concluded that the methodology would be applicable for further prediction of SIC stocks in the Tibetan Plateau or other similar areas.},

The first compari-son between IHS and SRS was conducted for mapping sand content of two soil layers in a study area in Anhui Province, China. Two sample sets of the same sample size were collected in the field based on IHS and SRS. The sec-ond case study is a simulation study, where we compared IHS and cLHS for mapping soil series in the Raffelson watershed in Wisconsin (USA). The study used an accurate and detailed soil series map produced previously as a proxy of the real soil distribution. Virtual samples with nine sample sizes designed by IHS and cLHS were collected on the soil map. For both case studies, an individual predictive soil mapping method was employed and independent validation samples were used to evaluate the mapping accuracies. Results indicate that IHS generally performs better than SRS for capturing distribu-tions of the environmental variables. It obtained higher mapping accuracies than SRS at different sample sizes. On the other hand, cLHS appears to pro-vide a better representation for distributions of the environmental variables than IHS, but the mapping accuracies with IHS are higher than those with cLHS at nearly all sample sizes. Finally, both case studies showed that IHS provides valuable information on representativeness of the samples.

abstract = {There is a growing need for spatially continuous and quantitative soil information for environmental modeling and management, especially at the national scale. This study was aimed at predicting soil particle-size fractions (PSF) for Nigeria using random forest model (RFM). Equal-area quadratic splines were fitted to Nigerian legacy soil profile data to estimate PSFs at six standard soil depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100, and 100-200 cm) using the GlobalSoilMap project specification. We applied an additive log-ratio (ALR) transformation of the PSFs. There was a better prediction performance (based on 33{\{}{\%}{\}} model validation) in the upper depth intervals than the lower depth intervals (e. g., R-2 of 0.53; RMSE of 13.59 g kg(-1) for clay at 0-5 cm and R-2 of 0.16; RMSE of 15.60 g kg(-1) at 100-200 cm). Overall, the PSFs show marked variations across the entire Nigeria region with a higher sand content compared with silt and clay contents and increasing clay content with soil depth. The variation in soil texture (ST) shows a progressive transition from a coarse texture (sand) along the fringes of northern Nigeria (e.g., upper part of Maiduguri and Sokoto), to finer texture (loam to clay loam) toward the western part of the Niger Delta region in the south. The inclusion of depth as a predictor variable significantly improved the prediction accuracy of RFM especially at lower depth intervals. These results could be used for producing soil function maps for national agricultural planning and in assessments of environmental sustainability.},

abstract = {We review various recent approaches to making digital soil maps based on geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, note some commonalities and propose a generic framework for the future. We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their ?environment?. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the ?environment?. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny?s five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution q and block size b. (ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q. (iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers. (iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites. (v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data. (vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham?s razor) with autocorrelated errors. (vii) Predict digital map. (viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing. (ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v). Finally, possible applications, problems and improvements are discussed.},

Thus, this study attempts to analyze the global scientific output of precision agriculture researches published during the period 2000–2016. By using a science mapping approach, mainly based on the application of network analysis tools, it was possible to investigate pivotal aspects of this research field such as publication trends, research topics and their geographical distribution. Using the Scopus database 17,756 scientific publications were retrieved from the chosen period. The number of publications increased after 2006, highlighting the vibrancy of the field. By authoring 35{\%} of the publications, U.S.A. and China were the most active knowledge producer countries. Moreover, the generation of time resolved maps allowed us to identify agriculture engineering, computer science and agriculture studies as three main research areas characterizing precision agriculture panorama. The paper discusses the distribution of these topics at global level, among European countries and in Italy. Overall, this analysis represents the first holistic view of precision agriculture research providing valuable information for farmers, policy makers and researchers.},

abstract = {The Paris Agreement emphasises a need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment uncertainties, together with the improved quantification of sinks and offsetting mechanisms, in order to develop appropriate mitigation measures aimed at keeping global temperature below 2 °C. Although the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool has the potential to act as a major source or sink of GHGs, depending on land use (LU) and soil type, it remains largely unquantified. In order to provide improved SOC assessments, depth-distribution models and pedotransfer functions were refined, and soil (National Soil Database and Indicative Soil Type) and land use (Land Parcel Identification System: 2000–2014) maps overlaid using ArcGIS to identify and categorize long-term LU changes for different soil types/categories. The range of SOC density (SOC$\rho$) for the different LUs was in the order, rough grazing (R) {\textgreater} grassland (G) {\textgreater} rotation/ley (GT) {\textgreater} tillage (T), and was highest in the organic soils. For the 0–30 cm soil layer, the SOC$\rho$ value (t C ha−1) measured in 2006 was 242 (R), 207 (G), 162 (GT) and 80 (T). The reference year (1990) values (SOC$\rho$ref), predicted using two-phase models, was 238 (R), 198 (G), 166 (GT) and 99 (T), t C ha−1. Based on the SOC$\rho$refvalues, G and R were sinks, whilst T and GT were sources. Regardless of LU, management and input, the IPCC default density change factor (DCF, {\%}) overestimated the annual rate of SOC$\rho$ change for the organo-mineral (42–124{\%}) and organic (73–156{\%}) soils compared to mineral soils. The corrected annual carbon sequestration rate for the four agricultural LUs combined, over 25 years, was 0.23, 0.42 and 0.53 t C ha−1yr−1for the 0–10, 0–30 and 0–100 cm layers. The corresponding national agricultural SOC stock (SOCs) for 2006 were 316, 838 and 1679 Tg. The long-term projections resulted in a carbon sink of 1.24, 3.09 and 5.48 Tg C yr−1, respectively, demonstrating a potential to offset 24, 59 and 106{\%} of the total GHGs emitted from Irish agriculture. These results show significant deficiencies in the IPCC methodology and that integrated approaches can provide robust estimates of SOC$\rho$/s and their long-term changes for disaggregated LUs and different soil categories. This study suggests replacement of the apportioning approach by depth-specific “mass by area” values for precise estimations of SOC$\rho$/s and their changes. It also emphasises the need for country/region-specific DCFs for individual LUs/management interventions, together with the use of specific weighting factors.},

abstract = {Land surface soil moisture (SSM) has important roles in the energy balance of the land surface and in the water cycle. Downscaling of coarse-resolution SSM remote sensing products is an efficient way for producing fine-resolution data. However, the downscaling methods used most widely require full-coverage visible/infrared satellite data as ancillary information. These methods are restricted to cloud-free days, making them unsuitable for continuous monitoring. The purpose of this study is to overcome this limitation to obtain temporally continuous fine-resolution SSM estimations. The local spatial heterogeneities of SSM and multiscale ancillary variables were considered in the downscaling process both to solve the problem of the strong variability of SSM and to benefit from the fusion of ancillary information. The generation of continuous downscaled remote sensing data was achieved via two principal steps. For cloud-free days, a stepwise hybrid geostatistical downscaling approach, based on geographically weighted area-to-area regression kriging (GWATARK), was employed by combining multiscale ancillary variables with passive microwave remote sensing data. Then, the GWATARK-estimated SSM and China Soil Moisture Dataset from Microwave Data Assimilation SSM data were combined to estimate fine-resolution data for cloudy days. The developed methodology was validated by application to the 25-km resolution daily AMSR-E SSM product to produce continuous SSM estimations at 1-km resolution over the Tibetan Plateau. In comparison with ground-based observations, the downscaled estimations showed correlation (R ≥ 0.7) for both ascending and descending overpasses. The analysis indicated the high potential of the proposed approach for producing a temporally continuous SSM product at fine spatial resolution.},

abstract = {Amazonia combines semi-continental size with difficult access, so both current ranges of species and their ability to cope with environmental change have to be inferred from sparse field data. Although efficient techniques for modeling species distributions on the basis of a small number of species occurrences exist, their success depends on the availability of relevant environmental data layers. Soil data are important in this context, because soil properties have been found to determine plant occurrence patterns in Amazonian lowlands at all spatial scales. Here we evaluate the potential for this purpose of three digital soil maps that are freely available online: SOTERLAC, HWSD, and SoilGrids. We first tested how well they reflect local soil cation concentration as documented with 1,500 widely distributed soil samples. We found that measured soil cation concentration differed by up to two orders of magnitude between sites mapped into the same soil class. The best map-based predictor of local soil cation concentration was obtained with a regression model combining soil classes from HWSD with cation exchange capacity (CEC) from SoilGrids. Next, we evaluated to what degree the known edaphic affinities of thirteen plant species (as documented with field data from 1,200 of the soil sample sites) can be inferred from the soil maps. The species segregated clearly along the soil cation concentration gradient in the field, but only partially along the model-estimated cation concentration gradient, and hardly at all along the mapped CEC gradient. The main problems reducing the predictive ability of the soil maps were insufficient spatial resolution and/or georeferencing errors combined with thematic inaccuracy and absence of the most relevant edaphic variables. Addressing these problems would provide better models of the edaphic environment for ecological studies in Amazonia.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) available in the literature to estimate soil bulk density ($\rho$b) in different regions of Brazil, using different metrics. The predictive capacity of 25 PTFs was evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE), mean error (ME), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and the regression error characteristic (REC) curve. The models performed differently when comparing observed and estimated $\rho$b values. In general, the PTFs showed a performance close to the mean value of the bulk density data, considered as the simplest possible estimation of an attribute and used as a parameter to compare the performance of existing models (null model). The models developed by Benites et al. (2007) (BEN-C) and by Manrique and Jones (1991) (M{\&}JB) presented the best results. The separation of data into two layers according to depth (0-10 cm and 10-30 cm) demonstrated better performance in the 10-30 cm layer. The REC curve allowed for a simple and visual evaluation of the PTFs.},

abstract = {Soil Security is a holistic soil assessment approach that cogitates soil as a multi-dimensional medium. Rather than traditional single dimensional assessment approaches such as land capability mapping that largely considers only soil and landscape biophysical attributes, the Soil Security concept considers social aspects, education, policy, legislation, current land use, condition and the soils natural and economic value to society. It can identify discrete soils that are currently being used within their capacity, and areas where a use might be unsustainable, i.e. not secure. It would therefore make sense to map this concept, which aligns well with the aspirational and marketing policies of the Tasmanian Government, where increased agricultural expansion through new irrigation schemes and multiple-use State managed production forests co-exists beside pristine World Heritage conservation land, a major drawcard of the economically important tourism industry. The spatial quantification of soil security is seen as an emerging tool to effectively protect the soil resource in terms of food and water security, biodiversity maintenance and safeguarding fragile ecosystems. The recent development and application of Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment capacities in Tasmania to stimulate agricultural production and better target appropriate soil resource use has formed the foundational system that can enable the first efforts in quantifying and mapping Soil Security, in particular the five Soil Security dimensions (Capability, Condition, Capital, Codification and Connectivity). This forms a preliminary mapping product that demonstrates the feasibility of mapping the Soil Security concept. To provide a measure of overall soil security, it was necessary to separately assess the State's three major soil uses; Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. These outputs provide an indication of where different activities are sustainable or at risk, where more soil data is needed, and develops a tool to better plan for a State requiring optimal food and fibre production, without depleting its natural soil resources and impacting the fragile ecosystems providing environmental benefits and supporting the tourism industry. The following paper demonstrates why and how we might map Soil Security, describing a preliminary approach to mapping the separate dimensions; this approach could be adapted and applied elsewhere as an evaluation tool to identify soil threats relevant to current land use, biophysical properties, policy and management, and stimulate further research and debate into developing a global Soil Security mapping methodology.},

In spite of being a necessary input to distributed hydrological models, regionalized soil water retention data from these areas are currently not available. The investigated catchment of the Quinuas River has a size of about 90 km2and comprises parts of the Cajas National Park in southern Ecuador. It is dominated by soils with high organic carbon contents, which display characteristics of volcanic influence. Besides providing spatial predictions of soil water retention at the catchment scale, the study presents a detailed methodological insight to model setup and validation of the underlying machine learning approach with random forest. The developed models performed well predicting volumetric water contents between 0.55 and 0.9 cm3cm− 3. Among the predictors derived from a digital elevation model and a Landsat image, altitude and several vegetation indices provided the most information content. The regionalized maps show particularly low water retention values in the lower Quinuas valley, which go along with high prediction uncertainties. Due to the small size of the dataset, mineral soils could not be separated from organic soils, leading to a high prediction uncertainty in the lower part of the valley, where the soils are influenced by anthropogenic land use.},

@article{Hengl2018a,
abstract = {Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using 5 – fold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as "knowledge engines" in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates, sensitivity of predictions to input data quality and extrapolation problems. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality — especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with fewer number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s). Introduction: Soil is the major reservoir of organic carbon. There is a paucity of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock data of afroalpine and sub-afroalpine vegetation in Ethiopia. Hence, this study was conducted to estimate the SOC stock and correlate it with soil physicochemical properties in Abune Yosef afroalpine and sub-afroalpine vegetation. Systematic sampling was employed to collect soil samples from upper 30 cm. Dry bulk density soil pH (1:2.5 water); organic carbon (Walkley and Black), and total nitrogen (Kjeldahl) were the methods used for soil analysis. Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis were performed in SPSS 24 statistical software. Results: The SOC stock of the study area was found to be 79.57 t C ha −1 . Soil organic carbon stock showed statistically significant positive correlation with vegetation type (r = 0.522, p {\textless} 0.01), bulk density (r = 0.62, p {\textless} 0.01), total nitrogen (r = 0.41, p {\textless} 0.01), and altitude (r = 0.468, p {\textless} 0.01) and negative correlation with slope (r = − 0.298, p {\textless} 0.05). The present study revealed similar soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default estimate for similar regions. Positive correlation of SOCS and altitude could be resulted from the variations in anthropogenic disturbances, temperature, and precipitation vegetation types. The negative correlation between SOCS and slope is the result from the predictably higher soil erosion at steeper slopes. Temporal livestock trampling increased the bulk density but never affected the SOCS to decline. Aspect did not show any significant relationship with SOCS due to either the under surveying of all aspects or similar solar radiation found in the study area. Moreover, gazing, aspect, and soil pH did not show statistically significant impact on SOCS. Conclusion: The SOCS of Abune Yosef afroalpine and sub-afroalpine vegetation is similar to the IPCC default estimate for similar regions. This is a great contribution both to the global and local terrestrial carbon sink.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved.It is often difficult for pedologists to "see" topsoils indicating differences in properties such as soil particle size. Satellite images are important for obtaining quick information for large areas. However, mapping extensive areas of bare soil using a single image is difficult since most areas are usually covered by vegetation. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a strategy to determine bare soil areas by fusing multi-temporal satellite images and classifying them according to soil textures. Three different areas located in two states in Brazil, with a total of 65,000 ha, were evaluated. Landsat images of a specific dry month (September) over five consecutive years were collected, processed, and subjected to atmospheric correction (values in surface reflectance). Non-vegetated areas were discriminated from vegetated ones using the Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Thus, we were able to fuse images with only bare soil. Field samples were taken from bare soil pixel areas. Pixels of soils with different textures (soil texture classifications) were used for supervised classification in which all areas with exposed soil were classified. Single images reached an average of 36 {\%} bare soil, where the mapper could only "see" these points. After using the proposed methodology, we reached a maximum of 85 {\%} in bare areas; therefore, a pedologist would have proper conditions for generating a continuous map of spatial variations in soil properties. In addition, we mapped soil textural classes with accuracy up to 86.7 {\%} for clayey soils. Overall accuracy was 63.8 {\%}. The method was tested in an unknown area to validate the accuracy of our classification method. Our strategy allowed us to discriminate and categorize different soil textures in the field with 90 {\%} accuracy using images. This method can assist several professionals in soil science, from pedologists to mappers of soil properties, in soil management activities.},

Thus, this study was based on the hypothesis that Atlantic Forest regions have a relevant capacity of atmospheric carbon absorption. For this purpose, the Gross Primary Production data provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor onboard the Earth-orbiting platform and its relationship with the climatic variables of the Itatiaia National Park were analyzed. The year 2015 presented the highest means of Gross Primary Production for the dry and rainy period when compared to 2005 and 2010, with values ranging from 7 g C m−2d−1to 8 g C m−2d−1. The highest negative trends were for temperature in the dry season of 2005 (Z = −0.29), rainfall in the dry period of 2010 (Z = −0.36) and 2015 in the annual and dry season (Z = −0.23 and −0.38). There was no significant trend of Gross Primary Production in the Itatiaia National Park. The land use and occupation classes that stand out with the highest values of mean Gross Primary Production are Dense Ombrophylous High-Montane Forest (9.98 g C m−2d−1) and Dense Montane Forest (9.09 g C m−2d−1). Temperature is the environmental factor of greatest variation among the seasons in the Itatiaia National Park region. The results of this study present relevant importance and contribution to the sustainable management of the Itatiaia National Park and subsidize programs that help in the recovery of uncharacterized areas of the Atlantic Forest.},

abstract = {Gully erosion has been identified as an important soil degradation process and sediment source, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Thus, it is useful to identify the spatial occurrence of this form of water erosion in the landscape and the most vulnerable areas. In this study, we explored the effects of different pixel sizes on some controlling factors extracted from a digital elevation model and remote sensing data when producing a gully erosion susceptibility map (GESM) of Ekbatan Dam Basin, Hamadan, Iran. An inventory map of the gully landforms was prepared based on global positioning system routes of the gullies, extensive field surveys, and visual interpretations of satellite images obtained from Google Earth. Five data sets with pixel sizes ranging from 2 to 30 m were obtained using topographic attributes and remote sensing data comprising the elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, catchment area, plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, topographic wetness index, land use, and normalized difference vegetation index, which can affect the distribution of gully erosion. For each data set, 70{\%} and 30{\%} of the data were selected randomly for calibrating and validating the models, respectively. The statistical relationships between the occurrence of gully erosion and controlling factors were calculated using four machine-learning models, i.e., generalized linear model, boosted regression tree (BRT), multivariate adaptive regression spline, and artificial neural network (ANN). Statistical tests comprising the kappa coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for both the calibration and validation data sets to estimate the optimal pixel size. The results showed that among the data sets with different pixel sizes, the optimal pixel size was 10 m for each model. In addition, the capacity of the four techniques for modeling gully erosion occurrence was quite stable when the calibration and validation samples were changed in the data set. Finally, based on three changes of the calibration and validation data sets with a pixel size of 10 m, the BRT and ANN models obtained outstanding performance (AUC {\textgreater} 0.9), where they had the highest goodness-of-fit and predictive power, and thus the greatest robustness to changes in the calibration/validation data (i.e., lowest sensitivity to altering calibration/validation data). Our results demonstrate the importance of selecting a suitable pixel size when producing a GESM for soil and water management practices.},

abstract = {Soil mapping has been identified as key to environmental issues. The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km2. The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the ‘true' but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5{\%} of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68{\%}. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92{\%} was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.},

abstract = {Sampling density significantly affects the estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) concentration because it influences the interpolation accuracy. High sampling density may ensure adequate estimation, but it is costly. Low number of samples may underrepresent spatial variation and generate unacceptable predictions. Identifying a reasonable sampling density is challenging, especially where the topography is complex and characterized by slope-rich terrain. Here we addressed this challenge by taking a large region of complex topography as study area. The region had a total area of 1.24 × 105km2and can be separated into three typical landforms, namely, hill-mountain, valley-basin, and plain-platform. Out of 235,309 sampling sites, 188,247 were randomly selected as training sites, on which 20 sampling densities were designed and ordinary kriging was interpolated. The remaining 47,602 sites were used as testing sites to calculate the accuracies of SOM concentration predictions at different sampling densities in the entire region of complex topography and its various landforms. Overall, the prediction accuracy was positively correlated with the sampling density (R2≥ 0.98). Specifically, with increasing sampling density, accuracy improved slowly at first then rapidly. However, the tipping point at which prediction accuracy significantly improved with the increases of sampling density varied among the areas. These sampling densities were 0.10, 0.11, 0.10, and 0.09 samples per hectare for the entire region, valley-basin, hill-mountain, and plain-platform, respectively. Further comparisons showed that valley-basin was the landform that had the best performance in interpolation accuracy, followed by hill-mountain, entire region and plain-platform. Their normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values were 23.86{\%}–28.91{\%}, 24.22{\%}–29.54{\%}, 25.32{\%}–30.77{\%}, and 31.21{\%}–37.76{\%}, respectively. Moreover, interpolation accuracy was more sensitive to sampling density in simple topography (flat regions such as plain-platform) than in complex landforms (slope-rich terrains like hill-mountain, and valley-basin). These variations in the relationships between interpolation accuracy and sample density suggest that topography must be considered when designing a scientific sampling density. More importantly, when a high level of interpolation accuracy and low sampling costs are required in regions of similar complex topography, our findings may help optimize soil sampling density.},

abstract = {Appropriate scale, justifiably reliable, categorical and continuous spatial soil information is urgently needed to address environmental problems and ensure sustainability of ecosystem services at local, regional and global scales. Regression Kriging (RK) is one of the most popular, practical and robust hybrid spatial interpolation techniques in the digital soil mapper's toolbox that enables the modeling of soil distribution patterns at multiple scales in space and time. Several theoretical and applied aspects of RK have been discussed; however, there are no review studies, which quantify the essential factors affecting the performance of RK. Materials for this review were gathered from high-quality international soil science journals: Catena, Geoderma, and Soil Science Society of America from 2004 to 2014. A total of 142 different models from 40 different articles were examined. The following criteria were considered to evaluate their impacts on the prediction efficiency of RK: i) soil geographic region, ii) area of extent, iii) spatial resolution, iv) target soil properties and/or classes v) sampling design, vi) sampling size and density, vii) sample depth viii) soil-environmental factors as predictors, ix) methods of transformation, x) factor analysis, xi) regression type, xii) model used for variogram, xiii) nugget to total sill ratio, xiv) spatial autocorrelation range, xv) coefficient of variation of observed dataset, xvi) evaluation method (note that in previous publications the term ‘validation' has been used extensively in publications in pedometrics) and xvii) coefficient of determination. The historical development of RK, limitations and strengths of current RK studies, research gaps, and future trends in RK are discussed. A major finding is the inverse relationship between the accuracy of RK models and the variation of soil properties in the original datasets. Novel modified RK methods are proposed for further investigation to predict soil properties and classes.},

abstract = {Digital soil maps with different scales have been widely used to quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in the upland-crop fields. However, most of the regional SOC modeling often uses soil maps with a fixed scale, thus how varying map scales influence modeled SOC dynamics has rarely been quantified. Different map scales have different levels of details in describing the soil properties (e.g., soil texture, SOC content, bulk density, and pH) for a specific area, with the high resolution map having finer spatial representation. In this study, six digital upland soil databases of the northern Jiangsu Province in Eastern China at scales of 1:50,000 (P5), 1:250,000 (P25), 1:500,000 (P50), 1:1,000,000 (P100), 1:4,000,000 (P400), and 1:10,000,000 (P1000) have been used to drive the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC, version 9.5) model to quantify SOC changes for the period of 1980–2009. This suite of scales selections covers all basic soil map scales in China. Our simulations indicate that the regional total SOC changes from 1980 to 2009 in the top layer (0–50 cm) for upland soils using P5, P25, P50, P100, P400, and P1000 soil maps were 37.89, 34.91, 36.04, 37.05, 39.28 and 38.46 Tg C, respectively. Taking the regional total SOC changes based on the most detailed soil map, P5, as a reference, the relative deviation of those derived from the P25, P50, P100, P400, and P1000 were 7.86{\%}, 4.86{\%}, 2.21{\%}, 3.67{\%}, and 1.51{\%}, respectively. Although the relative deviation of regional total SOC changes for most soil maps are low, disparities exist among SOC changes for different soil groups (i.e. 4.8 to 981{\%}) and for administrative areas level (i.e. 0.32 to 151{\%}). The results indicate that SOC estimates are significantly influenced by soil map scale. Lack of detailed soil information, like representation of many soil types and spatial variations in soil types, in coarse-scale maps result in the large uncertainties in the estimates of SOC changes. This study stresses the needs of detailed soil digital maps for accurate quantification of regional SOC changes.},

abstract = {An approach for using lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression in creating sparse 3D models of soil properties for spatial prediction at multiple depths is presented. Modeling soil properties in 3D benefits from interactions of spatial predictors with soil depth and its polynomial expansion, which yields a large number of model variables (and corresponding model parameters). Lasso is able to perform variable selection, hence reducing the number of model parameters and making the model more easily interpretable. This also prevents overfitting, which makes the model more accurate. The presented approach was tested using four variable selection approaches – none, stepwise, lasso and hierarchical lasso, on four kinds of models – standard linear model, linear model with polynomial expansion of depth, linear model with interactions of covariates with depth and linear model with interactions of covariates with depth and its polynomial expansion. This framework was used to predict Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in three contrasting study areas: Bor (Serbia), Edgeroi (Australia) and the Netherlands. Results show that lasso yields substantial improvements in accuracy over standard and stepwise regression — up to 50 {\%} of total variance. It yields models which contain up to five times less nonzero parameters than the full models and that are usually more sparse than models obtained by stepwise regression, up to three times. Extension of the standard linear model by including interactions typically improves the accuracy of models produced by lasso, but is detrimental to standard and stepwise regression. Regarding computation time, it was demonstrated that lasso is several orders of magnitude more efficient than stepwise regression for models with tens or hundreds of variables (including interactions). Proper model evaluation is emphasized. Considering the fact that lasso requires meta-parameter tuning, standard cross-validation does not suffice for adequate model evaluation, hence a nested cross-validation was employed. The presented approach is implemented as publicly available sparsereg3D R package.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition to soils is globally rising, but its effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover is still uncertain. Moreover, common theories of stoichiometric decomposition and microbial N mining predict opposing effects of N supply on SOC turnover. We hypothesized that the effect of N deposition on SOC turnover depends on initial soil nutrient conditions. Thus, we sampled tropical forests and rubber gardens with pronounced gradients of nutrient availability from the topsoil to the deep subsoil (up to 400 cm) and measured substrate-induced respiration (SIR) for 30 days in four treatments (C, CN, CP, CNP additions). A natural13C abundance approach was conducted to quantify priming effects (PE) of the added C on SOC mineralization. For this purpose we assessed the13CO2isotope composition after adding a C4 sugar to the C3 soil; to correct for isotopic fractionation a treatment with C3 sugar additions served as control. We found that nutrient additions to topsoil did neither alter cumulative CO2release within 30 days (SIRacc) nor PE (PE = 1.6, i.e., sugar additions raised the release of SOC-derived CO2by a factor of 1.6). In the upper subsoil (30–100 cm), however, both CN and CP additions increased SIRacc(by 239{\%} and 92{\%}, respectively) and the PE (PE = 5.2 and 3.3, respectively) relative to the treatments that received C only (PE = 1.7), while CNP additions revealed the largest increase of SIRacc(267{\%}) and PE (PE = 6.0). In the deep subsoil ({\textgreater}130 cm depth), only the CNP addition consistently increased SIRacc(by 871{\%}) and PE (PE = 5.2) relative to only C additions (PE = 2.0). We conclude that microbial activity was not limited by nutrients in the topsoil but was co-limited by both N and P in the subsoil. The results imply that microbes mine nutrients from previously unavailable pools under the conditions that 1) deficiency actually exists, 2) co-limitation is alleviated, and 3) nutrient reserves are present. Yet, as opposed to microbial nutrient mining theories, we showed that the subsoil PE is highest when nutrient supply matches microbial demand. As a result also N deposition might exert variable effects on SOC turnover in tropical soils: it might have no effect in nutrient-rich topsoils and in co-limited subsoils without P reserves but might increase SOC turnover in co-limited subsoils with potentially acquirable P reserves.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of soil respiration (SR) and its sensitivity to temperature (Q10) are one of the key uncertainties in climate change research but since their assessment is very time-consuming, large data sets can still not be provided. Here, we investigated the potential of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) to predict SR and Q10 values for 124 soil samples of diverse land use types taken from a 2868 km2catchment (Rur catchment, Germany/Belgium/Netherlands). Soil respiration at standardized temperature (25 °C) and soil moisture (45{\%} of maximum water holding capacity, WHC) was successfully predicted by MIRS coupled with partial least square regression (PLSR, R2= 0.83). Also the Q10 value was predictable by MIRS-PLSR for a grassland submodel (R2= 0.75) and a cropland submodel (R2= 0.72) but not for forested sites (R2= 0.03). In order to provide soil respiration estimates for arbitrary conditions of temperature and soil moisture, more flexible models are required that can handle nonlinear and interacting relations. Therefore, we applied a Random Forest model, which includes the MIRS spectra, temperature, soil moisture, and land use as predictor variables. We could show that SR can be simultaneously predicted for any temperature (5–25 °C) and soil moisture level (30–75{\%} of WHC), indicated by a high R2of 0.73. We conclude that the combination of MIRS with sophisticated statistical prediction tools allows for a novel, rapid acquisition of SR and Q10 values across landscapes and thus to fill an important data gap in the validation of large scale carbon modeling.},

abstract = {Efficient modelling methods to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have a pivotal importance as inputs for global carbon cycle studies and decision-making processes. However, laboratory analyses of SOC field samples are costly and time consuming. Global-scale estimates of SOC were recently made according to categorical variables, including land use and soil texture. Remote sensing (RS) data can contribute to the better modelling of the spatial distribution of SOC stock at a regional scale. In the present study, we used Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT) to estimate the topsoil (0–30{\"{i}}¿½cm) SOC stock of a Mediterranean semiarid area (Sicily, Italy, 25,286{\"{i}}¿½km2). In particular, our study examined agricultural lands, which represent approximately 64{\%} of the entire region. An extensive soil dataset (2202 samples, 1 profile/7.31{\"{i}}¿½km2on average) was acquired from the soil database of Sicily. The georeferenced field observations were intersected with remotely sensed environmental data and other spatial data, including climatic data from WORLDCLIM, land cover from CORINE, soil texture, topography and derived indices. Finally, the SGT was compared to published global estimates (GSOC) and data from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) Soil Grids by comparing the pseudo-regressions of the SGT, GSOC and ISRIC with soil observations. The mean SOC stock across the entire region that was estimated by GSOC and ISRIC was 3.9{\%} lower and 46.2{\%} higher compared to the SGT. The SGT efficiently predicted SOC stocks that were {\textless}{\"{i}}¿½70{\"{i}}¿½t{\"{i}}¿½ha−{\"{i}}¿½1(corresponding to the 90th percentile of the observed values). On average, the coefficient of variation of the SGT model was 3.6{\%} when computed on the whole dataset and remained lower than 23{\%} when computed on a distribution basis. The SGT mean absolute error was 14.84{\"{i}}¿½t{\"{i}}¿½ha−{\"{i}}¿½1, 18.4{\%} and 36.3{\%} lower than GSOC and ISRIC, respectively. The mean annual rainfall, soil texture, land use, mean annual temperature and Landsat 7 ETM+ panchromatic Band 8 were the most important predictors of SOC stock. Finally, SOC stocks were estimated for each land cover class. SGT predicted SOC stock better than GSOC and ISRIC for most data. This resulted in a percentage of data in the prediction confidence interval{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½{\"{i}}¿½50{\%} compared to the observed values of 71.4{\%}, 65.8{\%}, and 50.7{\%} for SGT, GSOC, and SGT, respectively. This consisted of a higher R2and a slope ($\beta$) that was closer to 1 for the pseudo-regression constructed with SGT compared to GSOC and ISRIC. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the integration of RS with climatic and soil texture spatial data could strongly improve SOC prediction in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In addition, the panchromatic band of Landsat 7 ETM{\"{i}}¿½+ was more predictive compared to the conventionally used NDVI. This information is crucial to guiding decision-making processes, especially at a regional scale and/or in semi-arid Mediterranean areas. The model performance of the SGT could be further improved by adopting predictors with greater spatial resolutions. The results of the present experiment yield valuable information, especially for assessing climate change or land use change scenarios for SOC stocks and their spatial distribution.},

abstract = {Spatial controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover are not well understood. We hypothesized that spatial patterns of SOC turnover are related to carbon (C) saturation rather than to the size of measurable SOC-pools such as particulate organic matter (POM), determined as SOC in particle-size fractions. Therefore, we repeatedly grid-sampled a field after one, three, seven, and eleven years under bare fallow management, which revealed a spatial gradient from high to low degrees of C saturation. We measured the contents of SOC and the contents of SOC in coarse sand-size (2000–250 $\mu$m, POM1), fine sand-size (250–53 $\mu$m, POM2), silt-size (53–20 $\mu$m, POM3), and fine silt to clay-size fractions (nonPOM, {\textless} 20 $\mu$m), calculated the degree of C saturation from textural properties and nonPOM contents, and related these parameters to SOC losses. In the first year of bare fallow, the soil contained on average 12.1 g SOC kg− 1, of which 0.6 g kg− 1, 1.7 g kg− 1, and 2.1 g kg− 1were lost after three, seven, and eleven years of bare fallow, respectively. The SOC losses within eleven years were spatially variable and varied between 1{\%} and 46{\%} relative to the initial SOC content. In support of our hypothesis, SOC losses were largest at subsites with largest degrees of C saturation (R2= 0.83). Although the POM fractions declined most drastically, they only comprised 4 to 9{\%} of bulk SOC, and they did neither correlate with nor explain spatial patterns of SOC losses. We conclude that the concept of C saturation is superior to conventional physical fractionation approaches for predicting spatio-temporal patterns of SOC turnover at sites with a high degree of C saturation.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is pivotal for biological, chemical and physical processes and provides vital information on changes in soil fertility and land degradation. Rangelands, accounting for about 81{\%} of Australian land area, are significant carbon (C) stores and small increases in soil C sequestration over such a vast area represents a considerable climate change mitigation opportunity. Efficient modelling techniques to evaluate the potential to increase rangeland SOC stocks are vitally important to assess their role in the global carbon cycle and quantum abatement. This study aimed to evaluate boosted regression trees (BRT) and random forest (RF) models in predicting SOC stocks from available continuous remotely sensed variables using two feature selection techniques. Dominant variables that affect SOC stocks in the rangelands were also identified. Using field-based measurements of SOC stock collected from 564 data points across the study area and 28 GIS-based environmental variables including climate, topography, radiometry, vegetation and land fractional cover data, we employed stepwise regression (SR, linear approach) and genetic algorithm (GA, nonlinear approach) to select the most informative variables. These selected predictors were then used to train the BRT and RF models. In all, four models were evaluated: BRT using SR (SR{\_}BRT); RF using SR (SR{\_}RF); BRT using GA (GA{\_}BRT) and RF using GA (GA{\_}RF). In addition, BRT using all predictors (All{\_}BRT) and the RF using all predictors (All{\_}RF) were used as benchmarks to test the performance of the four models. Of the field-based data, 75{\%} were used to train the model (“calibration dataset”) and the remaining 25{\%} were used to validate the prediction of SOC stocks (“validation dataset”). The results indicate that the RF exhibited a better performance in predicting SOC stocks than the BRT regardless of input variables. In addition, we verified that feature selection for both machine learning techniques is necessary for estimating SOC stocks because they can increase accuracy and save time. The GA{\_}RF was the most reliable method to predict SOC stocks, with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R2values (7.44 Mg C ha−1and 0.48, respectively), suggesting that the method of using GA-RF to generate a predictive model from measured data and remotely-sensed variables may provide a cost effective alternative to direct sampling to predict SOC stocks in the semi-arid rangelands of eastern Australia. The important variables for explaining the observed SOC stocks were rainfall, elevation, Prescott index (PI, a measure of water balance), and land fractional cover (bare ground fraction). The approach proposed here can be extended in areas where field observed data is scarce (e.g. rangelands) to produce more detailed information about SOC stocks. As such, the results of our study are of particular importance in Australian rangelands to provide a statistical and theoretical basis for producing digital SOC stock maps based on readily available remotely-sensed data, with potential for use in similar rangelands conditions internationally.},

Since its introduction in the early 1990s, the method has evolved several times into what is now known as "Super Learner". Super Learner uses V-fold cross-validation to build the optimal weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. Optimality is defined by a user-specified objective function, such as minimizing mean squared error or maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Although relatively simple in nature, use of the Super Learner by epidemiologists has been hampered by limitations in understanding conceptual and technical details.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Soil colour is often used as a general purpose indicator of internal soil drainage. In this study we developed a necessarily simple model of soil drainage which combines the tacit knowledge of the soil surveyor with observed matrix soil colour descriptions. From built up knowledge of the soils in our Lower Hunter Valley, New South Wales study area, the sequence of well-draining → imperfectly draining → poorly draining soils generally follows the colour sequence of red → brown → yellow → grey → black soil matrix colours. For each soil profile, soil drainage is estimated somewhere on a continuous index of between 5 (very well drained) and 1 (very poorly drained) based on the proximity or similarity to reference soil colours of the soil drainage colour sequence. The estimation of drainage index at each profile incorporates the whole-profile descriptions of soil colour where necessary, and is weighted such that observation of soil colour at depth and/or dominantly observed horizons are given more preference than observations near the soil surface. The soil drainage index, by definition disregards surficial soil horizons and consolidated and semi-consolidated parent materials. With the view to understanding the spatial distribution of soil drainage we digitally mapped the index across our study area. Spatial inference of the drainage index was made using Cubist regression tree model combined with residual kriging. Environmental covariates for deterministic inference were principally terrain variables derived from a digital elevation model. Pearson's correlation coefficients indicated the variables most strongly correlated with soil drainage were topographic wetness index (−0.34), mid-slope position (−0.29), multi-resolution valley bottom flatness index (−0.29) and vertical distance to channel network (VDCN) (0.26). From the regression tree modelling, two linear models of soil drainage were derived. The partitioning of models was based upon threshold criteria of VDCN. Validation of the regression kriging model using a withheld dataset resulted in a root mean square error of 0.90 soil drainage index units. Concordance between observations and predictions was 0.49. Given the scale of mapping, and inherent subjectivity of soil colour description, these results are acceptable. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of soil drainage predicted in our study area is attuned with our mental model developed over successive field surveys. Our approach, while exclusively calibrated for the conditions observed in our study area, can be generalised once the unique soil colour and soil drainage relationship is expertly defined for an area or region in question. With such rules established, the quantitative components of the method would remain unchanged.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) estimation is crucial to manage natural and anthropic ecosystems. Many modeling procedures have been tested in the literature, however, most of them do not provide information on predictors' behavior at specific sub-domains of the SOC stock. Here, we implement Quantile Regression (QR) to spatially predict the SOC stock and gain insight on the role of predictors (topographic and remotely sensed) at varying SOC stock (0–30cm depth) in the agricultural areas of an extremely variable semi-arid region (Sicily, Italy, around 25,000km2). QR produces robust performances (maximum quantile loss = 0.49) and allows to recognize dominant effects among the predictors at varying quantiles. In particular, clay mostly contributes to maintain SOC stock at lower quantiles whereas rainfall and temperature influences are constantly positive and negative, respectively. This information, currently lacking, confirms that QR can discern predictor influences on SOC stock at specific SOC sub-domains. The QR map generated at the median shows a Mean Absolute Error of 17 t SOC ha- 1with respect to the data collected at sampling locations. Such MAE is lower than those of the Joint Research Centre at Global (18 t SOC ha- 1) and at European (24 t SOC ha- 1) scales and of the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (23 t SOC ha- 1) while higher than the MAE reached in Schillaci et al. (2017b) (Geoderma, 2017, issue 286, page 35–45) using the same dataset (15 t SOC ha- 1). The results suggest the use of QR as a comprehensive method to map SOC stock using legacy data in agro-ecosystems and to investigate SOC and inherited uncertainty with respect to specific subdomains. The R code scripted in this study for QR is included.},

abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15{\%} (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

abstract = {The ensemble learning paradigm has proved to be relevant to solving most challenging industrial problems. Despite its successful application especially in the Bioinformatics, the petroleum industry has not benefited enough from the promises of this machine learning technology. The petroleum industry, with its persistent quest for high-performance predictive models, is in great need of this new learning methodology. A marginal improvement in the prediction indices of petroleum reservoir properties could have huge positive impact on the success of exploration, drilling and the overall reservoir management portfolio. Support vector machines (SVM) is one of the promising machine learning tools that have performed excellently well in most prediction problems. However, its performance is a function of the prudent choice of its tuning parameters most especially the regularization parameter, C. Reports have shown that this parameter has significant impact on the performance of SVM. Understandably, no specific value has been recommended for it. This paper proposes a stacked generalization ensemble model of SVM that incorporates different expert opinions on the optimal values of this parameter in the prediction of porosity and permeability of petroleum reservoirs using datasets from diverse geological formations. The performance of the proposed SVM ensemble was compared to that of conventional SVM technique, another SVM implemented with the bagging method, and Random Forest technique. The results showed that the proposed ensemble model, in most cases, outperformed the others with the highest correlation coefficient, and the lowest mean and absolute errors. The study indicated that there is a great potential for ensemble learning in petroleum reservoir characterization to improve the accuracy of reservoir properties predictions for more successful explorations and increased production of petroleum resources. The results also confirmed that ensemble models perform better than the conventional SVM implementation.},

abstract = {Climatic change in the last few decades has had a widespread impact on both natural and human systems, observable on all continents. Ecological and environmental models using climatic data often rely on gridded data, such as WorldClim. The main aim of this study was to devise and evaluate a computationally efficient approach to produce new high resolution (100 m) estimates of current and future climatic variables to be used at the national and regional scale. The test area was Great Britain, where local data are available and of good quality. Present and future climate surfaces were produced. For the present, the approach involved the integration, via spatial interpolation, of local climate information and WorldClim to reduce bias. For future climate scenarios the approach involved spatially downscaling of WorldClim (1 km) to a finer resolution of 100 m. The main advantages of the proposed approach are: 1. finer resolution, 2. locally adapted to the study area with use of higher number of meteorological stations and improved accuracy and bias, and 3. computationally efficient while making use of the existing resources provided by WorldClim. Two applications were presented to illustrate the practical consequences of improvements obtained with this method. The first is a measure of rainfall intensity, i.e. the R-factor, widely applied in erosion and catchment-scale studies. The second is an application to species distribution modelling, involving a range of bioclimatic variables. The results highlighted the importance of considering the spatial variability and structure of the data integrated in the modelling, and using data adapted to the geographical extent of the analysis, whenever possible. The results of the applications showed the advantage of using enhanced climatic data in applications such as the estimation of soil erosion, species range shift, carbon stocks and the provision of ecosystem services.},

The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated in the municipalities of Lajeado and Estrela, Brazil. The model was co-constructed by 101 experts from governmental organizations, universities, research institutes, NGOs, and private companies. Participatory methods such as the Delphi survey, focus groups, and workshops were applied. A participatory problem structuration, in which the modellers work closely with end users, was used to establish the structure of the vulnerability index. The preferences of each participant regarding the criteria importance were spatially modelled through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and analytical network process (ANP) multi-criteria methods. Experts were also involved at the end of the modelling exercise for validation. The final product is a set of individual and group flood vulnerability maps. Both AHP and ANP proved to be effective for flood vulnerability assessment; however, ANP is preferred as it considers the dependences among criteria. The participatory approach enabled experts to learn from each other and acknowledge different perspectives towards social learning. The findings highlight that to enhance the credibility and deployment of model results, multiple viewpoints should be integrated without forcing consensus.},

Understanding spatial variations of soil texture fractions and pH in flood plains is necessary for ensuring proper management of these plains, because these properties influence soil structure, fertility, hydraulic conductivity, infiltration, and erosion. In the present study, the distribution of soil texture fractions and pH was investigated in a flood plain with intensive wind erosion for an area of {\~{}} 41,000 ha in Zahak county of Sistan and Baluchestan province in eastern Iran. A random forest technique was used to link environmental variables and the studied properties. 460 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth across a 750 m grid. 361 samples were used for training and 99 for independent validation. Results showed that the distance from the river was the most important environmental variable for predicting soil texture fractions and pH in the study area. Natural channel networks, elevation, valley depth, LS factor, NDSI, vertical distance to channel networks, slope, wind effect, NDVI, and brightness were other important variables. The maps produced indicated a higher sand content near Sistan River. Clay, silt, and pH contents increased with distance from Sistan River. Results showed that clay and pH had a similar distribution in the study area. The values of RMSE for the maps of estimated sand, silt, clay, and pH in validation data were respectively 21.40, 17.45, 6.06 and 0.45. These values of RMSE for sand, silt, clay, and pH were respectively 10.3, 10.7, 15.1, and 13.3{\%} lower than a simple model (mean model). Results indicated that using the distance from the river and channel networks as a variable in digital soil mapping can increase the accuracy of the predictive maps of soil properties in flood plains.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Maintaining or increasing soil organic carbon (C) is important for securing food production, and for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, climate change and land degradation. Some land management practices in cropping, grazing, horticultural and mixed farming systems can be used to increase organic C in soil, but to assess their effectiveness, we need accurate and cost-efficient methods for measuring and monitoring the change. To determine the stock of organic C in soil, one needs measurements of soil organic C concentration, bulk density and gravel content, but using conventional laboratory-based analytical methods is expensive. Our aim here is to review the current state of proximal sensing for the development of new soil C accounting methods for emissions reporting and in emissions reduction schemes. We evaluated sensing techniques in terms of their rapidity, cost, accuracy, safety, readiness and their state of development. The most suitable technique for measuring soil organic C concentrations appears to be vis{\&}ndash;NIR spectroscopy and for bulk density active gamma-ray attenuation. Sensors for measuring gravel have not been developed, but an interim solution with rapid wet-sieving and automated measurement appears useful. Field-deployable, multi-sensor systems are needed for cost-efficient soil C accounting. Proximal sensing can be used for soil organic C accounting, but the methods need to be standardised and procedural guidelines need to be developed to ensure proficient measurement and accurate reporting and verification. This is particularly important if the schemes use financial incentives for landholders to adopt management practices to sequester soil organic C. We list and discuss the requirements for the development of new soil C accounting methods that are based on proximal sensing, including requirements for recording, verification and auditing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Current estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are calculated by multiplying the SOC density times the planimetric area of an individual cell. In the reality, the land surface is not always in horizontal planes, but sometimes in tilted planes, especially in mountainous regions. The differences between a horizontal plane and a tilted plane are controlled by slope, so we investigated the effect of inclination on the SOC stocks calculation using HWSD dataset in mountainous regions including the Alps, the Andes, the Plateau of Tibet and the Rocky Mountains. Our results showed that inclination effect strongly influenced SOC stocks calculation in mountainous regions and previous SOC stocks estimates were underestimated. SOC stocks increased between 4.04{\%} and 15.00{\%} when 90 m resolution elevation data was used for accounting the inclination effect, which was much higher than that of using 1 km resolution elevation (0.90{\%} to 5.00{\%}). Therefore, we suggest that it is necessary to consider the inclination effect in the calculation of SOC stocks in mountainous regions.},

abstract = {Although soils have a high potential to offset CO2emissions through its conversion into soil organic carbon (SOC) with long turnover time, it is widely accepted that there is an upper limit of soil stable C storage, which is referred to SOC saturation. In this study we estimate SOC saturation in French topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–50 cm), using the Hassink equation and calculate the additional SOC sequestration potential (SOCsp) by the difference between SOC saturation and fine fraction C on an unbiased sampling set of sites covering whole mainland France. We then map with fine resolution the geographical distribution of SOCspover the French territory using a regression Kriging approach with environmental covariates. Results show that the controlling factors of SOCspdiffer from topsoil and subsoil. The main controlling factor of SOCsp in topsoils is land use. Nearly half of forest topsoils are over-saturated with a SOCspclose to 0 (mean and standard error at 0.19 ± 0.12) whereas cropland, vineyard and orchard soils are largely unsaturated with degrees of C saturation deficit at 36.45 ± 0.68{\%} and 57.10 ± 1.64{\%}, respectively. The determinant of C sequestration potential in subsoils is related to parent material. There is a large additional SOCspin subsoil for all land uses with degrees of C saturation deficit between 48.52 ± 4.83{\%} and 68.68 ± 0.42{\%}. Overall the SOCsp for French soils appears to be very large (1008 Mt C for topsoil and 1360 Mt C for subsoil) when compared to previous total SOC stocks estimates of about 3.5 Gt in French topsoil. Our results also show that overall, 176 Mt C exceed C saturation in French topsoil and might thus be very sensitive to land use change.},

abstract = {136 samples were collected from soils under wet schlerophyll forest in southern Tasmania. The samples were from different depths and covered a wide range of bulk density and organic matter content. A simple linear relationship between specific volume (the reciprocal of bulk density) and low-temperature ignition loss was established. Since the variance about the regression tended to be homogeneous with bulk density rather than specific volume, the relationship was fitted as a generalized linear model using bulk density as the dependent variable with an ‘inverse' link and normal error assumption. For soils with loss-on-ignition at 375 ± 5°C (I) ranging from 1.8{\%} to 87.9{\%}, the bulk density, pb was given by an equation of the form l/pb=$\alpha$+$\beta$I, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants related to the bulk densities of the mineral and organic matter of the soils studied. The existence of the simple linear relationship in the deterministic part of the model implies that these soils are made up of a mineral framework and organic matter, with neither of the two components penetrating the interstices of the other.},

abstract = {Under field conditions in the Amazon forest, soil bulk density is difficult to measure. Rigorous methodological criteria must be applied to obtain reliable inventories of C stocks and soil nutrients, making this process expensive and sometimes unfeasible. This study aimed to generate models to estimate soil bulk density based on parameters that can be easily and reliably measured in the field and that are available in many soil-related inventories. Stepwise regression models to predict bulk density were developed using data on soil C content, clay content and pH in water from 140 permanent plots in terra firme (upland) forests near Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. The model results were interpreted according to the coefficient of determination (R2) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) and were validated with a dataset consisting of 125 plots different from those used to generate the models. The model with best performance in estimating soil bulk density under the conditions of this study included clay content and pH in water as independent variables and had R2 = 0.73 and AIC = -250.29. The performance of this model for predicting soil density was compared with that of models from the literature. The results showed that the locally calibrated equation was the most accurate for estimating soil bulk density for upland forests in the Manaus region.},

abstract = {Previous work has been put into the creation of a global soil taxonomy using a harmonised dataset of 23 soil properties at 18 depth intervals. The taxonomy consisted of selected soil taxa from the US Soil Taxonomy, World Reference Base for Soil Resources, the Australian Soil Classification, and the New Zealand Soil Classification. In this paper, a nomenclature algorithm was proposed for this established comprehensive taxonomy. Firstly, a Ward dendrogram was calculated from a weighted distance matrix determined from principal components of the taxa. This dendrogram was then cut at three levels, creating 15 groups, 86 subgroups, and 493 sub-subgroups at tiers 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A sequence of consonants was used to name the taxa at each tier alphabetically with “A” and “E” inserted between the consonants of tiers 2 and 3 and “OZEM” appended after the consonants of tier 1. In addition, a distance-based algorithm was used to allocate and name 10 unknown soil profiles to the comprehensive soil taxonomy. It was concluded that the nomenclature algorithm can be easily disaggregated by computer and can be used to understand the inter-relationships between soil profiles from different classification systems. In the future, there is a need to include other soil classification systems to the comprehensive system and assign different weights to the soil properties and depths used to construct the comprehensive soil classification system.},

abstract = {Soil taxonomies over the world are incongruent- based on different tiers and different sets of properties. This second paper is concerned with understanding the relationships of each tier (Order, Suborder and Great Group) in both Soil Taxonomy (ST) and the Australian Soil Classification system (ASC) using mean nearest neighbour distances and convex hull areas in two principal component dimensions. It is determined that in most instances, convex hull comparisons using only two principal components, representing 30{\%} of the variation in the data describe much of the variability between and within the orders, suborders and great groups of each classification system. These are useful for visual comparisons of taxa at various levels. Mean nearest-neighbour distances can include all 414 variables if necessary, which is more rigorous but complex. Both distance calculations and convex hulls highlight the same associations between taxa from ASC and ST. Both these methods demonstrate the robust soil classification capability of the ST and the ASC, but with convex hull sizes and nearest-neighbour distances that are smaller, the ASC proves to be slightly more coherent. The two systems occupy somewhat different areas in PC space, and ST covers a larger overall area, demonstrating that ASC is a purpose-built classification for Australian conditions while ST Is a more general system that can cover a wider variety of soils and management issues. We also show that great groups in ST are at about the same level of taxonomic generalization as great groups of the ASC. Combining the best elements and taxa of both these systems would be a positive step in the creation of a comprehensive system.},

abstract = {Sampling and analysis or visual examination of soil to assess its status and use potential is widely practiced from plot to national scales. However, the choice of relevant soil attributes and interpretation of measurements are not straightforward, because of the complexity and site-specificity of soils, legacy effects of previous land use, and trade-offs between ecosystem services. Here we review soil quality and related concepts, in terms of definition, assessment approaches, and indicator selection and interpretation. We identify the most frequently used soil quality indicators under agricultural land use. We find that explicit evaluation of soil quality with respect to specific soil threats, soil functions and ecosystem services has rarely been implemented, and few approaches provide clear interpretation schemes of measured indicator values. This limits their adoption by land managers as well as policy. We also consider novel indicators that address currently neglected though important soil properties and processes, and we list the crucial steps in the development of a soil quality assessment procedure that is scientifically sound and supports management and policy decisions that account for the multi-functionality of soil. This requires the involvement of the pertinent actors, stakeholders and end-users to a much larger degree than practiced to date.},

abstract = {Land use change strongly affects soil organic carbon (SOC), which is a critical driving force for soil quality and soil services. However, the influence of detailed land use dynamics on SOC remains an active research field. We investigated the impact of long-term grass-/cropland conversion dynamics on SOC for the Swiss agroecosystem (8‵500 km2). In Switzerland multi-temporal SOC observations are sparse, while the spatio-temporal resolution of available land use data is inadequate to capture small structured and dynamic land use. Thus, we stratified one-time SOC observations of two periods (n1995–1999= 1096; n2011–2015= 502) into typical land use classes of grass-/cropland conversion regimes to analyze states and trends of SOC. First, based on spectral imagery and auxiliary variables, we established a Random Forest classifier to detect annual grass-/cropland distributions in a spatial resolution of 30 × 30 m for 2000–2015. Second, we used the annual land use maps to derive classes of typical land use dynamics based on a pattern description of conversion regimes. Third, we comparatively assessed the SOC covariate importance (IMP) and SOC sample representation of land use dynamics using terrain and climate covariates. Subsequently, we statistically analyzed SOC across land use dynamics and two periods. The land use classifier shows an Overall Accuracy of 86{\%}, while the annual land use maps deviate by 6{\%}–11{\%} from census data. 46{\%} of the farmland underlies frequent grass-/cropland conversions. The SOC covariate importance of land use dynamics is increased by at least 2.4 times compared to the SOC covariates. The SOC observations consistently represent land use dynamics across SOC covariates. In both periods, SOC increased as the grassland share within the land use regimes increased. The mean SOC for permanent grasslands is 35 g kg−1and 17 g kg−1for permanent croplands. Areas of land use conversions where grassland is dominant show increased SOC (29–30 g kg−1) compared to areas where cropland was dominant (23–25 g kg−1). The mean differences of SOC between the periods and classes are statistically not significant except for permanent cropland, for which the SOC is decreased by 5.2 g kg−1.},

@article{DalFerro2018,
abstract = {Abstract Understanding the key drivers that affect a decline of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in agricultural areas is of major concern since leading to a decline in service provision from soils and potentially carbon release into the atmosphere. Despite an increasing attention is given to SOC depletion and degradation processes, SOC dynamics are far from being completely understood because they occur in the long term and are the result of a complex interaction between management and pedo-climatic factors. In order to improve our understanding of SOC reduction phenomena in the mineral soils of Veneto region, this study aimed to adopt an innovative probabilistic Bayesian belief network (BBN) framework to model SOC dynamics and identify management scenarios that maximise its accumulation and minimise GHG emissions. Results showed that the constructed BBN framework was able to describe SOC dynamics of the Veneto region, predicting probabilities of general accumulation (11.0{\%}) and depletion (55.0{\%}), similar to those already measured in field studies (15.3{\%} and 50{\%}, respectively). A general enhancement in the SOC content was observed where a minimum soil disturbance was adopted. This outcome suggested that management strategies of conversion from croplands to grasslands, no tillage and conservation agriculture are the most promising management strategies to reverse existing SOC reduction dynamics. Moreover, measures implying SOC stocks were also those providing major benefits in terms of GHGs reduction emissions. Finally, climate change scenarios slightly affected management practice. Advancements in our BBN framework might include more detailed classes at higher resolution as well as any socio-cultural or economic aspect that should improve the evaluation of prediction scenarios.},

abstract = {Land degradation is a serious issue especially in dry and developing countries leading to ecosystem services (ESS) degradation due to soil functions' depletion. Reliably mapping land degradation spatial distribution is therefore important for policy decisions. The main objectives of this paper were to infer land degradation through ESS assessment and compare the modelling results obtained using different sets of data. We modelled important physical processes (sediment erosion and nutrient export) and the equivalent ecosystem services (sediment and nutrient retention) to infer land degradation in an area in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. To model soil erosion/retention capability, and nitrogen export/retention capability, two datasets were used: a ‘global' dataset derived from existing global-coverage data and a hybrid dataset where global data were integrated with data from local surveys. The results showed that ESS assessments can be used to infer land degradation and identify priority areas for interventions. The comparison between the modelling results of the two different input datasets showed that caution is necessary if only global-coverage data are used at a local scale. In remote and data-poor areas, an approach that integrates global data with targeted local sampling campaigns might be a good compromise to use ecosystem services in decision-making.},

abstract = {Land use without adequate soil erosion control measures is continuously increasing the risk of soil erosion by water mainly in developing tropical countries. These countries are prone to environmental disturbance due to high population growth and high rainfall intensity. The aim of this study is to assess the state of soil erosion by water in Uganda at national and district levels, for various land cover and land use (LCLU) types, in protected areas as well to predict the impact of support practices on soil loss reduction. Predictions obtained using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model indicated that the mean rate of soil loss risk in Uganda's erosion-prone lands was 3.2 tha-1y-1, resulting in a total annual soil loss of about 62 million tons in 2014. About 39{\%} of the country's erosion-prone lands were comprised of unsustainable mean soil loss rates {\textgreater}1 tha-1y-1. Out of 112 districts in Uganda, 66 districts were found to have unsustainable estimated soil loss rates {\textgreater}1 tha-1y-1. Six districts in Uganda were found to have mean annual soil loss rates of {\textgreater}10 tha-1y-1: Bududa (46.3 tha-1y-1), Kasese (37.5 tha-1y-1), Bundibugyo (28.9 tha-1y-1), Bulambuli (20.9 tha-1y-1), Sironko (14.6 tha-1y-1) and Kotido (12.5 tha-1y-1). Among the LCLU types, the highest soil loss rates of 11 tha-1y-1 and 10.6 tha-1y-1 were found in moderate natural forest and dense natural forest, respectively, mainly due to their locations in highland areas characterized by steep slopes ranging between 16{\%} to 21{\%} and their high rainfall intensity, ranging from 1255 mmy-1 to 1292 mmy-1. Only five protected areas in Uganda were found to have high mean estimated mean soil loss rates {\textgreater}10 tha-1y-1: Rwenzori Mountains (142.94 tha-1y-1), Mount Elgon (33.81 tha-1y-1), Bokora corridor (12.13 tha-1y-1), Matheniko (10.39 tha-1y-1), and Nangolibwel (10.33 tha-1y-1). To manage soil erosion in Uganda's protected areas, there is an urgent need to control wildfires and human-induced disturbances such as timber harvesting and soil compaction from domestic animals. Our study analysis revealed that well-established terraces and strip-cropping could significantly reduce soil loss rates in Uganda's croplands by 80{\%} (from 1.5 tha-1y-1 to 0.3 tha-1y-1) and by 47{\%} (from 1.5 tha-1y-1 to 0.8 tha-1y-1), respectively, well below the sustainable soil erosion tolerance rate (1 tha-1y-1) for land and water conservation.},

abstract = {Existing sample data are important for digital soil mapping. Different sample points possess different representativeness. The representativeness of samples influences the soil mapping result greatly. However, few study focus on assessing the representativeness of single sample. In this paper, we proposed a method to identify representative samples from existing samples collected from multiple resources. The basic idea of the method was to use clusters of environmental covariates to approximate types of soil variations, and check the occupancy of the existing samples in centroids of environmental clusters. Those samples locating in typical locations or centroids of environmental clusters were considered as representative samples. In this paper, the proposed method was used to discern representative samples in 282 soil samples in Anhui Province, China. SOM content was mapped using a similarity based mapping method. Two cases with different training samples (representative samples, non-representative samples, and training samples including representative and non-representative samples) and validation samples were set to compare the mapping results and accuracies. The results showed that the SOM content maps predicted using representative training samples had generally higher accuracy than the results produced using non-representative samples, and comparative accuracies with the results produced using full training samples. To discern representative samples is helpful for understanding the soil-landscape relationships in an area and the proposed method can be used to design supplementary samples for a better soil mapping result. Mapping results and accuracies showed that different training and validation sample sets impacted the mapping results and accuracies greatly, which indicates that researchers should be cautious when using randomization to obtain training and validation subsets for soil mapping.},

After the error removal, land areas mapped with ±2 m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39{\%} to 58{\%}. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.},

abstract = {The valuation of ecosystem services (ES) employs a range of methods. Based on a literature review and selected empirical examples, we consider major opportunities and challenges in ecosystem services valuation. We analyse when different valuation methods are appropriate and most useful. We demonstrate that mechanisms to capture benefits and costs are needed; and that the use of valuation should be incorporated more widely in decision-making. However, we argue that ecosystems are complex systems: neither the ecosystems or the services that they provide are a sum, but are an interrelated system of components. If a component vanishes the whole system may collapse. Therefore, critical natural capital management, in particular, cannot rely on monetary values; whilst the maintanance of the whole system should be considered. Monetary valuation of biodiversity and landscapes is also problematic because of their uniqueness and distinctiveness, a shortage of robust primary valuations, and numerous complexities and uncertainties. We conclude that mixed method and deliberative discourse techniques, as well as proper integration of research tools, should be more widely applied to help decision-makers and the public to understand and assess changes in ES. The approaches developed and tested by us, as presented in this paper, can provide more complete, comprehensive and impartial insights into a range of benefits that humans derive from ecosystems.},

The Tool is free to use, and offers five different techniques for eliciting univariate probability distributions. A key feature of the Tool is that users can log in from different sites and view and interact with the same graphical displays, so that expert elicitation sessions can be conducted remotely (in conjunction with tele- or videoconferencing). This will make probability elicitation easier in situations where it is difficult to interview experts in person.

abstract = {Eco-environmental vulnerability assessment is crucial for environmental and resource management. However, evaluation of eco-environmental vulnerability over large areas is a difficult and complex process because it is affected by many variables including hydro-meteorology, topography, land resources, and human activities. The Thua Thien - Hue Province and its largest river system, the Perfume River, are vital to the social-economic development of the north central coastal region of Vietnam, but there is no zoning system for environmental protection in this region. An assessment framework is proposed to evaluate the vulnerable eco-environment in association with 16 variables with 6 of them constructed from Landsat 8 satellite image products. The remaining variables were extracted from digital maps. Each variable was evaluated and spatially mapped with the aid of an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS). An eco-environmental vulnerability map is assorted into six vulnerability levels consisting of potential, slight, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy vulnerabilities, representing 14{\%}, 27{\%}, 17{\%}, 26{\%}, 13{\%}, 3{\%} of the study area, respectively. It is found that heavy and very heavy vulnerable areas appear mainly in the low and medium lands where social-economic activities have been developing rapidly. Tiny percentages of medium and heavy vulnerable levels occur in high land areas probably caused by agricultural practices in highlands, slash and burn cultivation and removal of natural forests with new plantation forests. Based on our results, three ecological zones requiring different development and protection solutions are proposed to restore local eco-environment toward sustainable development. The proposed integrated method of remote sensing (RS), GIS, and AHP to evaluate the eco-environmental vulnerability is useful for environmental protection and proper planning for land use and construction in the future.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society. Expert judgement informs a variety of important applications in conservation and natural resource management, including threatened species management, environmental impact assessment and structured decision-making. However, expert judgements can be prone to contextual biases. Structured elicitation protocols mitigate these biases, and improve the accuracy and transparency of the resulting judgements. Despite this, the elicitation of expert judgement within conservation and natural resource management remains largely informal. We suggest this may be attributed to financial and practical constraints, which are not addressed by many existing structured elicitation protocols. In this paper, we advocate that structured elicitation protocols must be adopted when expert judgements are used to inform science. In order to motivate a wider adoption of structured elicitation protocols, we outline the IDEA protocol. The protocol improves the accuracy of expert judgements and includes several key steps which may be familiar to many conservation researchers, such as the four-step elicitation, and a modified Delphi procedure ("Investigate," "Discuss," "Estimate" and "Aggregate"). It can also incorporate remote elicitation, making structured expert judgement accessible on a modest budget. The IDEA protocol has recently been outlined in the scientific literature; however, a detailed description has been missing. This paper fills that important gap by clearly outlining each of the steps required to prepare for and undertake an elicitation. While this paper focuses on the need for the IDEA protocol within conservation and natural resource management, the protocol (and the advice contained in this paper) is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains, as evidenced by its application to biosecurity, engineering and political forecasting. By clearly outlining the IDEA protocol, we hope that structured protocols will be more widely understood and adopted, resulting in improved judgements and increased transparency when expert judgement is required.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the application of ecological vulnerability analysis in risk assessment and describes new developments in methodology. For generic non-site-specific assessments (e.g. for the requirements of most European directives on dangerous chemicals) risk is characterised just on the basis of the ratio between an effect indicator and an exposure indicator. However, when the actual risk for a specific ecosystem is desired, the concept of ecological vulnerability may be more appropriate. This calls for a change in thinking, from sensitivity at the organism level to vulnerability at higher organization levels, and thus forms the link from laboratory toxicology to field effects at population, community or ecosystem level. To do so, biological and ecological characteristics of the ecosystems under concern are needed to estimate the ecological vulnerability.In this review we describe different vulnerability analysis methods developed for populations (of a single species), communities (consisting of different populations of species) and ecosystems (community and habitat combined). We also give some examples of methods developed for socio-ecological systems. Aspects that all methods share are the use of expert judgment, the input of stakeholders, ranking and mapping of the results, and the qualitative nature of the results.A new general framework is presented to guide future ecological vulnerability analysis. This framework can be used as part of ecological risk assessment, but also in risk management. We conclude that the further quantification of ecological vulnerability is a valuable contribution to vulnerability assessment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is important to soil fertility and the global carbon cycle. Accurate estimates of SOC stock and its dynamics are critical for managing agricultural ecosystems and carbon accounting under climate change, especially for highly cultivated regions. We extensively surveyed the SOC levels in 29,927 sites in Zhejiang province, an intensively cultivated region of East China, from year 2007 to 2008. We then estimated the spatial distribution of topsoil (0–30 cm) organic carbon stock using a random forest (RF) model, which is a powerful machine learning algorithm with superior predictive performance over parametric statistical models. The final RF model contained 23 predictor variables, covering soil properties, vegetation, climate, topography, land cover, farming practices, and locations. The RF model showed high performance in predicting the SOC stock, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.63 t C ha−1. This performance was superior to the General Linear Model (GLM) (R2= 0.35, RMSE = 19.93 t C ha−1) and the ordinary kriging (OK) method (R2= 0.57, RMSE = 14.44 t C ha−1), and was equivalent to Boosted Regressing Trees (BRT) (R2= 0.73, RMSE = 11.26 t C ha−1). According to the variable importance evaluation, soil properties were the most important predictor variables, followed by climate and location, with relative importance values of 61{\%}, 17{\%}, and 14{\%}, respectively. The predicted SOC stock ranged from 14.8 to 125.5 t C ha−1, with an average ± standard deviation of 50.1 ± 12.3 t C ha−1. The mean SOC level obtained from this survey was considerably lower than the value of 60.5 t C ha−1reported for the same region in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), which is the most commonly used soil database worldwide. A large spatial discrepancy of SOC stock was observed between this survey and HWSD in regional and sub-regional levels. This study provided an updated regional baseline map of SOC levels for improving farmland management and refining carbon accounting under climate change.},

abstract = {The Geographic Information Systems brought greater possibilities to the representation and interpretation of the landscape as well as the integrated analysis. However, this approach does not dispense technical and methodological substantiation for achieving the computational universe. This work is grounded in ecodynamics and empirical analysis of natural and anthropogenic environmental Fragility and aims to propose and present an integrated paradigm of Multi-criteria Analysis and Fuzzy Logic Model of Environmental Fragility, taking as a case study of the Basin of Monjolinho Stream in S{\~{a}}o Carlos-SP. The use of this methodology allowed for a reduction in the subjectivism influences of decision criteria, which factors might have its cartographic expression, respecting the complex integrated landscape. {\textcopyright} 2014 Journal of Urban and Environmental Engineering (JUEE).

abstract = {Geomorphology is fundamental to landscape analysis, as it represents the main parameter that determines the land spatial configuration and facilitates reliefs classification. The goal of this article is the elaboration of thematic maps that enable the determination of different landscape units and elaboration of quality and vulnerability synthetic maps for landscape fragility assessment prior to planning human activities. For two natural spaces, the final synthetic maps were created with direct (visual-perceptual features) and indirect (cartographic models and 3D simulations) methods from thematic maps with GIS technique. This enabled the creation of intrinsic and extrinsic landscape quality maps showing sectors needing most preservation, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic landscape fragility maps (environment response capacity or vulnerability towards human actions). The resulting map shows absorption capacity for areas of maximum and/or minimum human intervention. Sectors of high absorption capacity (minimum need for preservation) are found where the incidence of human intervention is minimum: escarpment bottoms, fitted rivers, sinuous high lands with thick vegetation coverage and valley interiors, or those areas with high landscape quality, low fragility and high absorption capacity, whose average values are found across lower hillsides of some valleys, and sectors with low absorption capacity (areas needing most preservation) found mainly in the inner parts of natural spaces: peaks and upper hillsides, synclines flanks and scattered areas. For the integral analysis of landscape, a mapping methodology has been set. It comprises a valid criterion for rational and sustainable planning, management and protection of natural spaces.},

Examples are presented of applying the metrics to 3 real-world models of wildlife population analysis and management. Using such metrics can vitally bolster model credibility, acceptance, and appropriate application, particularly when informing management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are useful tools for modeling ecological predictions and aiding resource-management decision-making. We provide practical guidelines for developing, testing, and revising BBNs. Primary steps in this process include creating influence diagrams of the hypothesized “causal web” of key factors affecting a species or ecological outcome of interest; developing a first, alpha-level BBN model from the influence diagram; revising the model after expert review; testing and calibrating the model with case files to create a beta-level model; and updating the model structure and conditional probabilities with new validation data, creating the final-application gamma-level model. We illustrate and discuss these steps with an empirically based BBN model of factors influencing probability of capture of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw)). Testing and updating BBNs, especially with peer review and calibration, are essential to ensure their credibility and reduce bias. Our guidelines provide modelers with insights that allow them to avoid potentially spurious or unreliable models.},

abstract = {The soil organic matter (SOM) content and dynamic are related to vegetation cover, climate, relief, and geology; these factors have strong variation in space in the southeastern of Brazil. The objective of the study was to compare and evaluate performance of classical multiple linear regressions (MLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) and chemical fractions of organic matter in the Brazilian southeastern mountainous region. The regression models were fitted based on SOC and chemical fractions of SOM. The points (n = 89) were selected by pedologist's experience along transects and toposequences. The covariates were also selected using the empirical knowledge of pedologists when choosing variables that drive soil carbon content and its dynamics. Geology map, legacy soils map, terrain attributes derived from digital elevation model, and remote sensing indices derived from RapidEye sensor bands were used as covariates. In all MLR models (except for fulvic acid fraction [FAF]), the legacy soil map was selected as a covariate by the stepwise approach. The geology map was not selected as important covariate to predict FAF and humin (HUM). At least one variable derived from remote sensing was selected by the adjusted models. For the prediction of the SOC, HUM, and FAF, the GWR models had the highest performance. The MLR models extrapolated the results, especially for SOC. The relationships among SOC, SOM fractions, and environmental covariates were affected by local landscape variability, and the GWR model was better at modeling.},

abstract = {Ecosystem Services{\_}web Introduction 2 The 1995 adoption by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) of the Ecosystem Approach as its primary framework (Secretariat of the CBD, 2000) stimulated interest in how natural systems deliver ecosystem services to societies around the world. Further stimuli have been the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) and the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (2011). In response there has been a very substantial research effort coalescing around improving understanding of: 1) measuring and mapping ecosystem services; 2) how natural systems and their biodiversity deliver ecosystem services; 3) the valuation of ecosystem services; 4) how interactions between people and the environment deliver services; 5) how ecosystem services and the ecosystem approach support sustainable land management. Research in the 2011-2016 Scottish Government Strategic Research Programme addresses these questions, and this booklet summarises its headline findings. We begin with fundamentals, considering the terminology which has built up around the Ecosystem Approach and ecosystem service concepts (Chapter 1), and the role of biodiversity in regulating ecosystem functions (Chapter 2). Modelling and mapping of ecosystem services starts to demonstrate national-level patterns of service delivery (Chapter 3). However, some services -including cultural services -remain difficult to assess; new approaches are therefore needed (Chapter 4). Valuation of ecosystem services enables the development of natural capital accounts, but there are multiple approaches and a need for context-appropriate methods (Chapter 5). Case studies explore how approaches to participatory decision-making (in some cases using service mapping and valuation) can help balance multiple demands for services (Chapter 6). Decision-making can be further aided by tools for envisaging how particular policy goals might lead to different configurations of land use (Chapter 7). Considering the Ecosystem Approach overall (which includes ecosystem service assessments), there may be key barriers which impede the uptake of this type of framework (Chapter 8), whilst a considerable challenge at the local scale is understanding how people's interactions with the environment generate ecosystem services (Chapter 9). Two case studies demonstrate how many ecosystem services are co-produced by people and ecosystems, highlighting limitations of existing ecosystem service assessments. Finally we explore ES delivery by specific ecosystems and management regimes. Considering delivery of water-related services in catchments and peatlands (Chapter 10), we see how 'environmental' policies support Scottish society and the economy. Consideration of service delivery in cropland systems (Chapter 11) shows that -particularly in intensively farmed systems -key supporting services are reduced, but also that data are available to target action for service restoration. Finally we explore nature conservation and ecosystem service delivery (Chapter 12), demonstrating that sites managed for nature conservation overall deliver higher levels of services than non-protected sites, but also highlighting limitations in the data available for assessments. The work introduced here addresses many of the key challenges of developing and implementing the ecosystem service and Ecosystem Approach concepts and highlights important future directions to progress this field.},

This study was carried out by using landsat imageries of 2001, 2010 and 2015. Images were classified into categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis. Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation modeling was applied in a GIS environment to quantify the potential soil erosion risk. The area under grassland, woodland and homesteads have increased by 610.69 (4{\%}), 101.69 (0.67{\%}) and 126.6 ha (0.83{\%}) during 2001–2015. The extent of cultivated land and shrub/bushland was reduced by 323.43(0.02{\%}) and 515.44 ha (3.41{\%}), respectively, during the same period. The vegetation cover in the watershed decreased by 91{\%} during 2001–2010, and increased by 88{\%} during 2010–2015. Increase of NDVI values indicates better ground cover due to implementation of integrated watershed development program in the region. The estimated annual soil losses were 7.2tha−1yr−1 in 2001, 7.7t ha−1yr−1in 2010 and 4.8tha−1yr−1in 2015. Management interventions are necessary to improve the status and utilization of watershed resources in response to sustainable land management practices for sustainable livelihood of the local people.},

abstract = {Soil erosion is a very critical form of land degradation resulting in the loss of soil nutrients and downstream sedimentation of water storages in the highlands of Ethiopia. As it is technically and financially impossible to conserve all landscapes affected by erosion, identification of priority areas of intervention is necessary. Spatially distributed erosion models can help map landscape susceptibility to erosion and identify high erosion risk areas. Integration of erosion models with geographic information systems (GIS) enables assessing evaluate the spatial variability of soil erosion and plan implementing conservation measures at landscape levels. In this study, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation adjusted for sediment delivery ratio was used in a GIS system to assess landscape sensitivity to erosion and identify hotspots. The approach was applied in three catchments with size being 10–20 km2 and results were compared against quantitative and semi-quantitative data. The model estimated mean soil loss rates of about 45 t ha−1 y−1 with an average variability of 30{\%} between catchments. The estimated soil loss rate is above the tolerable limit of 10 t ha−1 y−1. The model predicted high soil loss rates at steep slopes and shoulder positions as well as along gullies. The results of the study demonstrate that knowledge of spatial patterns of high soil loss risk areas can help deploy site-specific conservation measures.},

However, vertical accuracy of the data decreases with increase in slope and elevation due to presence of large outliers and voids. Therefore, studies using SRTM data " as is " , especially in regions like the Himalaya, are not statistically meaningful. New data from {\~{}}200 high-precision static Global Position System (GPS) Independent Check Points (ICPs) in the Himalaya and Peninsular India indicate that only 1-arc X-Band data are usable " as is " in the Himalaya as it has height accuracy of 9.18 m (RMSE). In contrast, recently released (2014–2015) " as-is " 1-arc and widely used 3-arc C-Band data have a height accuracy of RMSE 23.53 m and 47.24 m and need to be corrected before use. Outlier and void filtering improves the height accuracy to RMSE 8 m, 10.14 m, 14.38 m for 1-arc X and C-Band and 3-arc C-Band data respectively. Our study indicates that the C-Band 90 m and 30 m DEMs are well-aligned and without any significant horizontal offset implying that area and length computations using both the datasets have identical values.

In this study,$\backslash$nsoil erosion parameters were investigated at micro-scale and macro-scale$\backslash$nin forests in northern Iran. Surface erosion and some vegetation$\backslash$nattributes were measured at the watershed scale in 30 parcels of land$\backslash$nwhich were separated into 15 fire-affected (burned) forests and 15$\backslash$noriginal (unburned) forests adjacent to the burned sites. The soil$\backslash$nerodibility factor and splash erosion were also determined at the$\backslash$nmicro-plot scale within each burned and unburned site. Furthermore, soil$\backslash$nsampling and infiltration studies were carried out at 80 other sites, as$\backslash$nwell as the 30 burned and unburned sites, (a total of 110 points) to$\backslash$ncreate a map of the soil erodibility factor at the regional scale. Maps$\backslash$nof topography, rainfall, and cover-management were also determined for$\backslash$nthe study area. The maps of erosion risk and erosion risk potential were$\backslash$nfinally prepared for the study area using the Revised Universal Soil$\backslash$nLoss Equation (RUSLE) procedure. Results indicated that destruction of$\backslash$nthe protective cover of forested areas by fire had significant effects$\backslash$non splash erosion and the soil erodibility factor at the micro-plot$\backslash$nscale and also on surface erosion, erosion risk, and erosion risk$\backslash$npotential at the watershed scale. Moreover, the results showed that$\backslash$ncorrelation coefficients between different variables at the micro-plot$\backslash$nand watershed scales were positive and significant. Finally, assessment$\backslash$nand monitoring of the erosion maps at the regional scale showed that the$\backslash$ncentral and western parts of the study area were more susceptible to$\backslash$nerosion compared with the western regions due to more intense$\backslash$ncrop-management, greater soil erodibility, and more rainfall. The$\backslash$nrelationships between erosion parameters and the most important$\backslash$nvegetation attributes were also used to provide models with equations$\backslash$nthat were specific to the study region. The results of this paper can be$\backslash$nuseful for better understanding erosion processes at the micro-scale and$\backslash$nmacro-scale in any region having similar vegetation attributes to the$\backslash$nforests of northern Iran.},

abstract = {Soil classification as a world exercise consists of predominantly individual organizations, creating locally meaningful categories for regional soils. This process has inevitably created a recognized disconnect between classification systems, and a push for a universal classification has been proposed. In this paper, as a way of standardization between systems, soil taxa at the great group level from two separate regions and soil classification systems, Australia and the United States of America were represented by separate databases of soil profile descriptions (SPDs) comprising the same 23 properties at 18 depth intervals. Taxa centroids from Soil Taxonomy (ST) and the Australian Soil Classification System (ASC) were calculated via principal component analysis. Convex hulls of each soil order of both systems were created and the associations each taxon had with other individuals in the same taxon discussed, as well as the variance. We determined that ASC orders have smaller overall dispersion compared with the ST. The influence of each property to the overall taxonomic distances was also explored. It was concluded that this analysis opened the way for the possibility of comparing differing taxonomies and could pave the way for a more comprehensive classification method.},

abstract = {The Amazon Forest plays a major role in C sequestration and release. However, few regional estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in this ecoregion exist. One of the barriers to improve SOC estimates is the lack of recent soil data at high spatial resolution, which hampers the application of new methods for mapping SOC stock. The aims of this work were: (i) to quantify SOC stock under undisturbed vegetation for the 0-30 and the 0-100cm under Amazon Forest; (ii) to correlate the SOC stock with soil mapping units and relief attributes and (iii) to evaluate three geostatistical techniques to generate maps of SOC stock (ordinary, isotopic and heterotopic cokriging). The study site is located in the Central region of Amazon State, Brazil. The soil survey covered the study site that has an area of 80km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and resulted in a 1:10,000 soil map. It consisted of 315 field observations (96 complete soil profiles and 219 boreholes). SOC stock was calculated by summing C stocks by horizon, determined as a product of BD, SOC and the horizon thickness. For each one of the 315 soil observations, relief attributes were derived from a topographic map to understand SOC dynamics. The SOC stocks across 30 and 100cm soil depth were 3.28 and 7.32kg C m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively, which is, 34 and 16{\%}, lower than other studies. The SOC stock is higher in soils developed in relief forms exhibiting well-drained soils, which are covered by Upland Dense Tropical Rainforest. Only SOC stock in the upper 100cm exhibited spatial dependence allowing the generation of spatial variability maps based on spatial (co)-regionalization. The CTI was inversely correlated with SOC stock and was the only auxiliary variable feasible to be used in cokriging interpolation. The heterotopic cokriging presented the best performance for mapping SOC stock.},

Of 842 spring locations found, 70{\{}{\%}{\}} (589) were implemented for model training, and the rest of them were used to evaluate the models. The mentioned models were run and groundwater potential maps (GPMs) were produced. At last, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the efficiency of the methods. The results of the current study denoted that RFGA, and RF methods had better efficacy than different kernels of SVM model. Area under curve (AUC) of ROC value for RF and RFGA was estimated as 84.6, and 85.6{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively. AUC of ROC was computed as SVM- linear (78.6{\{}{\%}{\}}), SVM-polynomial (76.8{\{}{\%}{\}}), SVM-sigmoid (77.1{\{}{\%}{\}}), and SVM- radial based function (77{\{}{\%}{\}}). Furthermore, the results represented higher importance of altitude, TWI, and slope angle in groundwater assessment.

abstract = {Until recently, Tasmanian environmental modelling and assessments requiring important soil inputs relied on conventionally derived soil polygons that were mapped up to 75 years ago. In the ‘Wealth from Water' project, digital soil mapping (DSM) was used in a pilot project to map the suitability of 20 different agricultural enterprises over 70 000 ha. Following on from this, the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries Parks Water and Environment has applied DSM to existing soil datasets to develop enterprise suitability predictions across the whole state in response to further expansion of irrigation schemes. The soil surfaces generated have conformed and contributed to the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia, a superset of GlobalSoilMap.net specifications. The surfaces were generated at 80-m resolution for six standard depths and 13 soil properties (e.g. pH, EC, organic carbon, sand and silt percentages and coarse fragments), in addition to several Tasmanian enterprise-suitability soil-attribute parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe modelling used soil site data with available explanatory state-wide spatial variables, including the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model and derivatives, gamma-radiometrics, surface geology, and multi-spectral satellite imagery. The DSM has delivered realistic mapping for most attributes, with acceptable validation diagnostics and relatively low uncertainty ranges in data-rich areas, but performed marginally in terms of uncertainty ranges in areas such as the World Heritage-listed Southwest of the state, with a low existing soil site density. Version 1.0 soil-attribute maps form the foundations of a dynamic and evolving new infrastructure that will be improved and re-run with the future collection of new soil data. The Tasmanian mapping has provided a localised integration with the National Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia, and it will guide future investment in soil information capture by quantitatively targeting areas with both high uncertainties and important ecological or agricultural value.},

abstract = {Most existing soil classification systems were developed to understand and provide information on soils, their natural properties and potential use for certain purposes. The conceptual developments of the systems took place before the recent boom of observation technologies, data storage and data processing achievements that can support to determine or predict soil differences. Until the recent past soils under agricultural or forestry use received more attention than other soils, such as anthropogenically modified or urban soils, or soils of the cold regions. The broader view of soil functions and the understanding of global environmental processes require a better understanding and description of all soils. Precisely recorded and harmonized data is needed to serve the new era of modern agricultural practices, other land uses as well as different scientific applications. The soil science community is challenged to apply the accumulated knowledge on soil formation, soil differences and functions, as well as, new tools of robust data processing to evaluate current systems and define objective relationships for better future classification systems. The evaluation of existing soil classification systems may help the understanding of taxonomic relationships of differentiated soil groups and improve our methods of classifying soils. This paper is summarizing the approaches and methods of evaluation that was applied for the great group and higher levels of Soil Taxonomy. Simple statistical and pedometric methods were applied on centroids and, calculated on the basis of properties commonly used to define the classification units. The centroids provide an objective tool to evaluate the concepts of taxa and the taxonomic relationships between them. Examples of conceptual evaluations and detailed discussions of the taxonomic distance calculations between the great groups within their orders and members of other orders are provided. The presented methods and relationships were found very useful for the evaluation purpose. The extension of the methods for other systems, other data bases and the combination of those is in progress. The initial results suggest that the objective, pedometric approaches can support the development of an envisioned Universal Soil Classification System.},

abstract = {Evaluating the accuracy of allocation to classes in monothetic hierarchical soil classification systems, including the World Reference Base for Soil Classification, US Soil Taxonomy, and Chinese Soil Taxonomy, is poorly-served by binomial methods (correct/incorrect allocation per evaluation observation), since some errors are more serious than others in terms of soil properties, map use, pedogenesis, and ease of mapping. Instead, evaluations should account for the taxonomic distance between classes, expressed as class similarities, giving partial credit to some incorrect allocations. These can then be used in weighted accuracy measures, either direct measures of agreement or measures that account for chance agreement, such as the tau index. Similarities can be determined in one of four ways: (1) by the expert opinion of a soil classification specialist; (2) by the distance between classes in a numerical taxonomy assessment; (3) by distance within a taxonomic hierarchy; or (4) by an error loss function. Expert opinion can be from the point of view of the map user, to assess map utility, or map producer, to assess mapping skill. Examples are given of determining similarity between a subset of Chinese Soil Taxonomy classes by expert opinion and by numerical taxonomy from soil spectra, and then using these for weighted accuracy assessment. A method for assessing the accuracy of probabilistic predictions of several classes at a location is also proposed.},

Basing on the data obtained, some proposals for the development of the Russian soil classification system have been formulated. Most of the orders are charac-terized by considerable taxonomic distances between them, and their identification in the classification system is doubtless. Small taxonomic distances are characteristic of the following pairs of orders: organo-accumulative and structural-metamorphic soils, hydrometamorphic soils and lithozems, and cryometamorphic and eluvial soils. Therefore, criteria for defining some orders, and/or profile formulas for some soil types composing the orders may be revised. The comparison of taxonomic distances between soil orders in the Russian system and between Reference Soil Groups in the international system allows us to suggest their certain similarity.},

abstract = {A common and simple approach to evaluate models is to regress predicted vs. observed values (or vice versa) and compare slope and intercept parameters against the 1:1 line. However, based on a review of the literature it seems to be no consensus on which variable (predicted or observed) should be placed in each axis. Although some researchers think that it is identical, probably because r2 is the same for both regressions, the intercept and the slope of each regression differ and, in turn, may change the result of the model evaluation. We present mathematical evidence showing that the regression of predicted (in the y-axis) vs. observed data (in the x-axis) (PO) to evaluate models is incorrect and should lead to an erroneous estimate of the slope and intercept. In other words, a spurious effect is added to the regression parameters when regressing PO values and comparing them against the 1:1 line. Observed (in the y-axis) vs. predicted (in the x-axis) (OP) regressions should be used instead. We also show in an example from the literature that both approaches produce significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nowadays, French soil scientists tend to gather new and existing soil data into a common database. The use of this database potentially allows for resolving environmental issues, largely through soil mapping. The purpose of this study is to present a methodology for mapping soil types illustrated by typical observations in the soil database, in this case from the La Rochelle area on the French Mid-Atlantic Coast. The main hypothesis underlying the method is that soil types result from environmental factors such as landform, parent material, and land cover. The method can be divided into four stages. The first step is to construct a local soil type classification from the database by a two-stage continuous classification procedure. The result of this procedure is that at each observation point, the soil is described by a vector of taxonomic distances to each of k centroidal soil types. In the example given, k= 18. The second step involves fitting soil-environment equations, one for each centroidal soil type, by regressing taxonomic distances on layers of multivariate environmental data observed on a fine 20-m grid, by multiple linear regression. In this case, the layers are terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model and land cover attributes derived from three bands of a SPOT image. The third step is to predict k maps or raster GIS layers representing taxonomic distances to soil types on the 20-m grid, using the soil-environment equations and the kriging of the residuals from the regressions. This results in many potential maps: a summary map depicting the nearest centroidal soil type (the soil type for which the taxonomic distance is least) at each location is possibly the most useful, and another one representing the minimum taxonomic distance which, if considered too large, might suggest locations for further field survey to refine the soil types. A map of standard errors of the kriged taxonomic distance residuals to the nearest centroidal soil type can be made to indicate spatial uncertainty. Continuous fuzzy membership maps can also be constructed from the distances. The fourth step involves validation with an independent soil data set allowing Agronomic Research Institute (INRA) in Surg{\`{e}}res, for entering all the data; R. Salin for data collection; and Professor Alex McBratney for his constructive pedometric and editorial comments.},

abstract = {Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling have been important drivers in the advancement of our understanding of soil from the earliest days of the scientific study of soils. Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modern era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the application of taxonomic distance calculations for the correlation of soil units from different soil classification systems. Conceptual and centroid-based methods were tested on the brown forest soil types of the Hungarian Soil Classification System, correlatedwith the Reference SoilGroups of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources. The results of the distance calculations were compared and evaluated with previous expert based correlation studies. Earlier studies to derive taxonomic distances between soil taxa based on their dominant identifiers were further developed with the introduction of finer coding, and the application for correlation purposes. For the centroid-based approach, values were calculated from legacy laboratory data of different soil properties of the studied soil classes to derive the taxonomic distances. The results of the three different approaches are concordant, but as each method studied has its own limitations, we recommend their joint application. Therefore themethods complement each other and provide a good tool to assist correlation tasks. We found this study very helpful in identifying the shortcomings of certain definitions and the conceptual conflicts within and between systems. The numerical approaches should be applied in the evaluation of current systems in the efforts toward a Universal Soil Classification System. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Land cover and land use change have altered hydrologic processes. However, there are still some uncertainties on the magnitudes of these effects in tropical regions. Here, we evaluate the effect of soil tillage and land cover on soil water infiltration, through measurement of this parameter in areas under bare soil, soybeans (conventional tillage and no-tillage) and pasture. We use a portable rainfall simulator with a constant intensity rain (60 ± 1.715 mm h−1) in plots of 0.7 m2 in size. In total, 96 rains were applied, 24 in each treatment, after soil preparation and in five stages after soybean sowing (every 20 days). We use the observed data to fit three infiltration models, Kostiakov-Lewis, Horton and Philip, whose the quality of adjustment, was verified by correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Our results show that the stable infiltration rate (SIR) in the no-tillage soybean system is greater than in the other systems by 40 days. Furthermore, SIR values in bare soil (BS) and soybean under conventional tillage (SCT) systems do not differ (p {\textless} 0.05), except at 80 days after soybean sowing (SIR BS = 14.28 mm h−1 and SIR SCT = 24.00 mm h−1). We find that Horton's model adjusts the best to the different systems, with an R = 0.88, 0.86, 0.47 and 0.63, RMSE = 4.46, 4.87, 5.76 and 8.12, and NSE = 0.78, 0.74, 0.23 and 0.45, for the BS, SCT, SNT and PA systems, respectively. However, the Kostiakov-Lewis and Philip models adjust is very close, independent of the presence of vegetal cover and soil tillage. We conclude that soil water infiltration is more influenced by vegetal cover, depending on the type of land use, than by the soil tillage system.},

Role of forest SOC and N stocks in global C cycle has been a subject of great research recently, but the effect of topographic features on their dynamics at the stand level has received less attention especially under temperate conditions. In order to find out how topographic aspect and altitude affect SOC and N budgets, a study was conducted in the Himalayan Mawer Forest Range. We examined SOC and N stocks at two altitude zones (Z1: 1800–2200 masl {\&} Z2: 2200–2500 masl) under North (N) and South (S) aspects at three soil depths (D1: 0–20 cm, D2: 20–40 cm and D3: 40–60 cm). The SOC stock was found to be decreasing with altitude from 105.9 Mg ha− 1 to 78.3 Mg ha− 1 under N aspect and from 81.6 Mg ha− 1 to 74.0 Mg ha− 1 under S aspect. SOC stock was higher by 16.5{\%} under N aspect as compared to S aspect. The results lead to the conclusion that altitude has a negative effect on SOC stabilization and therefore altitude and aspect effect may be included in SOC stock estimation equations.},

abstract = {Forest soils are important components in the global C-cycle. Regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are hampered by low spatial densities of routine soil inventories. In this study, we estimated the SOC stock in the upper meter of forest in the region of Flanders (N. Belgium) using four digital soil mapping techniques, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and compared them with the results of a multi-level spatial generalisation (MLSG) approach. Applied to a collection of 276 soil profiles, we identified the highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm under forests. Overall, BRT was the most informative as it obtained the best fit (training R2 of 0.68, cross-validated R2 of 0.22) and provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. With BRT, the total stock in the upper meter of forest soil (153,544 ha) was estimated to be 26.99 Mt OC, or 17.58 kg m−2 on average. MLSG provided an estimate for only 90{\%} of the forest area and resulted in a larger average stock of 18.22 kg m−2 due to larger predictions for Histosols. As a null model, i.e. assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30.00 Mt OC, or 21.26 kg OC m−2 on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1,168,850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255.28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the amount of predictions under the actual land cover. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling approaches can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors.},

abstract = {The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is an important indicator in ecosystem service assessments. Even though a considerable fraction of the total stock is stored in the subsoil, current assessments often consider the topsoil only. Furthermore, mapping efforts are hampered by the limited spatial density of these topsoil measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm of soil in 30,556 ha of Low-Input High-Diversity systems, such as nature reserves, in Flanders (Belgium) and compare this estimate with the stock found in the topsoil (upper 15 cm). To this end, we combined depth extrapolation of 139 measurements limited to the topsoil with four digital soil mapping techniques: multiple linear regression, boosted regression trees, artificial neural networks and least-squares support vector machines. Particular attention was given to vegetation characteristics as predictors. For both the stock in the upper 15 cm and 100 cm, a boosted regression trees approach was most informative as it resulted in the lowest cross-validation errors and provided insights in the relative importance of predictors. The predictors of the stock in the upper 100 cm were soil type, groundwater level, clay fraction and community weighted mean (CWM) and variance (CWV) of plant height. These predictors, together with the CWM of specific leaf area, aboveground biomass production, CWV and CWM of rooting depth, terrain slope, CWM of mycorrhizal associations and species diversity also explained the topsoil stock. Our total stock estimates show that focusing on the topsoil (1.63 Tg OC) only considers 36{\%} of the stock in the upper 100 cm (4.53 Tg OC). Given the magnitude of subsoil OC and its dependency on typical ecosystem characteristics, it should not be neglected in regional ecosystem service assessments.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of modelling the uncertainty about the value of continuous soil attributes, at any particular unsampled location (local uncertainty) as well as jointly over several locations (multiple-point or spatial uncertainty). Two approaches are presented: kriging-based and simulation-based techniques that can be implemented within a parametric (e.g. multi-Gaussian) or non-parametric (indicator) frameworks. As expected in theory and illustrated by case studies, the two approaches yield similar models of local uncertainty, yet the simulation-based approach has several advantages over kriging: (1) it provides a model of spatial uncertainty, e.g. the probability that a given threshold is exceeded jointly at several locations can be readily computed, (2) conditional cumulative distribution function (ccdf) for supports larger than the measurement support (e.g. remediation units or flow simulator cells) can be numerically approximated by the cumulative distribution of block simulated values that are obtained by averaging values simulated within the block, and (3) the set of realizations allows one to study the propagation of uncertainty through global GIS operations or complex transfer functions, such as flow simulators that consider many locations simultaneously rather than one at a time. The other issue is the evaluation of the quality or "goodness" of uncertainty models. Two new criteria (exceedence probability plot and narrowness of probability intervals that include the true values) are presented to assess the accuracy and precision of local uncertainty models using cross-validation. According to the second criterion, multi-Gaussian kriging performs better than indicator kriging for the hydraulic conductivity (HC) data set. However, looking at the distribution of flow simulator responses, sequential indicator simulation (sis) yields better results than sequential Gaussian simulation (sGs) that does not allow for significant correlation of extreme values (destructuration effect). ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {SOC is the most important indicator of soil fertility and monitoring its space-time changes is a prerequisite to establish strategies to reduce soil loss and preserve its quality. Here we modelled the topsoil (0–0.3 m) SOC concentration of the cultivated area of Sicily in 1993 and 2008. Sicily is an extremely variable region with a high number of ecosystems, soils, and microclimates. We studied the role of time and land use in the modelling of SOC, and assessed the role of remote sensing (RS) covariates in the boosted regression trees modelling. The models obtained showed a high pseudo-R2 (0.63–0.69) and low uncertainty (s.d. {\textless} 0.76 g C kg− 1 with RS, and {\textless} 1.25 g C kg− 1 without RS). These outputs allowed depicting a time variation of SOC at 1 arcsec. SOC estimation strongly depended on the soil texture, land use, rainfall and topographic indices related to erosion and deposition. RS indices captured one fifth of the total variance explained, slightly changed the ranking of variance explained by the non-RS predictors, and reduced the variability of the model replicates. During the study period, SOC decreased in the areas with relatively high initial SOC, and increased in the area with high temperature and low rainfall, dominated by arables. This was likely due to the compulsory application of some Good Agricultural and Environmental practices. These results confirm that the importance of texture and land use in short-term SOC variation is comparable to climate. The present results call for agronomic and policy intervention at the district level to maintain fertility and yield potential. In addition, the present results suggest that the application of RS covariates enhanced the modelling performance.},

abstract = {Soil plays a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. In the 1990s ecosystem services (ES) research focused on developing the concept and framework and only a few studies linked soil properties to ecosystem services. This study reviews the literature on the relationship between soils and ecosystem services and aims to contribute to the scientific understanding on soil and ecosystem services and their interrelations. Most studies have focused on provisioning and regulating ES relating to soil physico-chemical properties. Cultural services had only a few studies, and supporting services were mostly related to soil physico-chemical and biological properties. The number of ES papers increased rapidly after 2000 and in the past 5. years, regulating services such as carbon sequestration, climate and gas regulations, were commonly studied. Once the concept was established in the 1990s, studies focusing on the assessment, valuation, and payments of services became more prominent. Most soil-ES research is published in Geoderma. Soil scientists seems to be hesitant to use the term 'ecosystem services' even if their research is devoted to linking soils to ecosystem services. We suggest that future ES research should focus on exploring soil functional diversity of soil biota and the spatial aspects of soil properties to lower level ecosystem services (e.g., water purification, gene pool, and climate regulation). Soil scientists should engage professionals from other disciplines to further promote the contribution of soils to ecosystem services delivery and human well-being. ES soil studies could be used in local and national policy development and program on natural resource use and management.},

abstract = {Soil bulk density (Db) measurement is essential to estimate soil carbon reserves. However, field sampling, specially at depth, and direct measurement of Db is labor intensive, tedious and often impractical. Thus regression models or pedotransfer functions (PTFs) based on easily measured soil properties are an alternative for laborious Db measurements. A forward stepwise multiple regression routine was used to predict Db from 17 soil properties using a data set (data set 1) constructed from the Soil Archives of Embrapa Solos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A first exploratory regression model using 1002 soil samples of data set 1 led to the development of a model, which indicated that total nitrogen (N), clay content (Clay) and sum of basic cations (SB) were the three strongest contributors to Db prediction (Adjusted-R2 = 0.71, Standard error of the estimate = 0.10). A simplified regression model was developed using easily-measured soil attributes, such as soil organic carbon (TOC), Clay and SB. This model described 66{\%} of the variation of Db in 1396 soil samples distributed at all depths (Standard error of the estimate = 0.11). Clay content showed a good correlation with predicted Db (Beta value = - 0.58) followed by TOC (Beta value = - 0.51) and SB (Beta value = 0.21). Partitioning the data set 1 into groups by soil depth (0-30 and 30-100 cm) and soil order (Latossolos and Argissolos) did not improve the accuracy of regression equations. In addition, we tested the Db predictive potential of the proposed model and three existing models (two from Brazil and one from the US) on an independent soil data set (data set 2). A general overestimation of predicted Db by the US model, with mean predicted error (MPE) of 0.11 shows that published PTFs developed on different environments should be used with care. Existing Brazilian models developed for the Amazon biome, on the other hand, were found to produce a slight underestimation with MPE values ranging from - 0.03 to - 0.16. The proposed simple regression model including Clay, TOC and SB was observed to be the most accurate and least biased. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is a serious lack of detailed and accurate three-dimensional soil distribution information worldwide. This study examined the effectiveness of combining radial basis function (RBF) neural networks and profile depth functions to map the three-dimensional distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) in a subtropical hilly landscape in southern Anhui Province, China. The RBF networks were used to predict the lateral distribution of SOM based on its relations with terrain attributes and land uses, while the depth functions were used to fit its vertical distribution based on sparse measurements of SOM in soil genetic horizons. Compared with power and logarithmic functions, the equal-area quadratic splines had smaller bias, higher accuracy, and more stable performance in fitting the vertical SOM distribution. The prediction accuracy of the whole three-dimensional mapping method decreased with depth within the upper 60 cm, while the best accuracy occurred below 60 cm. In the upper 30 cm, areas with high elevation tended to have high predicted SOM content and vice versa. There were local deviations from this pattern in areas where toeslopes and ravines had higher predicted SOM content than backslopes, even though the latter are at higher elevations. Multiple regressions with dummy variables showed that the influence of terrain conditions on SOM content was strong in the upper 60 cm and weak below 60 cm, while that of land use was strong in the upper 30 cm and weak below 30 cm. Both influences were the strongest in the upper 15-cm soil layer. Under the same terrain conditions, agricultural cultivation is associated with SOM accumulation in the upper 30 cm.},

Soil depth is an important input parameter in slope stability analysis. This paper provides the spatial variation of soil depth and the occurrence of slope failure in Sangun mountains area. The spatial pattern of soil depth was simulated by proses based model using airborne laser survey data (LiDAR data) and Geographic Information System (GIS) function. As a function for soil production, we use in the study area a numerical model developed by Dietrich et al. (1995) to predict the local spatial variation of the depth of soil. The soil depth data measured at 20 locations that represent morphological variability are used as a sample data set to test the model results. Furthermore, the soil depth variations are compared to the slope failure distribution in the whole area. Slope failure locations in the study area are identified from interpretation of aerial photographs and field surveys. Fifty-five of slope failures are considered for slope failure hazard analysis. Therefore, the slope failures occur more frequently at soil depth intervals in the ranged from 1.01 m to 1.5 m.},

abstract = {Soil is one of the most important natural resource and its heterogeneity reflects the variability of its chemical and physical attributes. Soil heterogeneity occurs due to the natural process of formation and use by men and management. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the spatial variability of physical and chemical soil attributes and map the spatial distribution of these in Posses sub-basin, Extrema, representative of the Atlantic Forest biome present in southern Minas Gerais. For this, samples (0-0.20 m depth) were collected at 150 points, and their physical and chemical attributes were determined. Variables: Ca, Mg, K, P, pH, organic matter (MO), geometric mean diameter of aggregates (DMGcp), weighted mean diameter of aggregates (DMPcp) and flocculation index (IF) showed spatial dependence structure, which allowed mapping from geostatistical techniques. P, DMGsp and DMPsp presented structure with nugget effect, possibly due to an insufficient distance to capture spatial dependence in the sample for these attributes, and human interferences.

abstract = {Soil class maps are useful representations of the landscape distribution of holistic soil functions. However these are often only available as generalized classes at small cartographic scales. One reason is that allocating a soil profile to a class in most current soil classification system requires laboratory determination of many diagnostic soil properties. The advantage of reflectance spectroscopy along with the development of spectral libraries can provide a relatively low-cost solution to this problem. Reflectance spectroscopy has demonstrated its ability to rapidly predict soil physio-chemical properties; however prediction accuracy varies among soil properties. When properties predicted with different accuracies are used to substitute for traditional laboratory determinations in allocating a soil profile to a class, the resulting reliability of the allocation is questionable. The objective of this research is to explore whether the soil properties predicted by reflectance spectroscopy can be used to correctly allocate soil profiles into soil taxa at different hierarchical levels. Two hundred and six soil profiles were allocated to eight Orders, 12 Suborders, 23 Groups and 49 Subgroups according to Chinese Soil Taxonomy, with the help of ten soil properties predicted by spectra using ten-fold cross-validated PLSR modelling. The overall allocation accuracy at Order, Suborder, Group and Subgroup level was 98.5{\%}, 98.5{\%}, 87.7{\%} and 76.0{\%} respectively. These results show that soil reflectance spectroscopy can assist in allocation of profiles. When predicted soil properties with varying accuracy are used for soil allocation, propagation of prediction errors and model uncertainties must be considered. We propose the use of multiple indicators (RPD, confidence intervals, comparison of RMSE and threshold requirements) to evaluate the allocation results.},

Spatial sampling techniques are more efficient than conventional sampling when surveying spatially distributed targets such as CO2 emissions, soil pollution, a population distribution, disaster distribution, and disease incidence, where spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity are prevalent. However, despite decades of development in theory and practice, there are few computer programs for spatial sampling. We investigated the three-fold relationship between targets, sampling strategies and statistical methods in spatial contexture. Accordingly, the information flow of the spatial sampling process was reconstructed and optimized. SSSampling, a computer program for design-based spatial sampling, has been developed from the theoretical basis. Three typical applications of the software, namely sampling design, optimal statistical inference and precision assessment, are demonstrated as case studies.},

abstract = {Whereas contemporary land use and land management planning require specific and quantitative georeferenced soil information, often only general-purpose and qualitative soil maps are available. With a view to fill this gap for topsoil clay and organic carbon content in the central plateaus of Burundi, we tested for a representative 15km2 hilly landscape, six types of SCORPAN models. The SCORPAN models were first applied as standalone trend models and next extended with a component accounting for the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals from the trend. Various sets of predictors, including class variables derived from the available soil map and continuous derivatives from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and from Landsat-imagery were incorporated. For clay, the best prediction method was a Residual Kriging (RK) using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) as trend built with only DEM derivatives and spectral normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Furthermore, the classical and simplest RK, i.e. using a Least Squares Linear Regression (LR) trend built with only continuous covariates, outperformed all standalone trend models. For organic carbon, residuals from the trend models were not significantly auto-correlated, making RK meaningless. In this case the best model was a GAM combining lithologic units with DEM derivatives and NDVI. Overall, the contribution of soil map???derived predictors to the model performance was rather weak. It was concluded that, for prediction of specific soil characteristics in the study area, a SCORPAN approach is preferred the more as the performance can be boosted by kriging of trend residuals if auto-correlated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in maintaining fertility and productivity in sandy soils. This study mapped the spatial variability of SOC concentration, A-horizon thickness, and SOC stocks from the Central Sands in Wisconsin. Soil samples were collected from three different areas (area A, B, and C) that were sampled through grid sampling (GS, n = 100), conditioned latin hypercube sampling (cLHS, n = 100), and random sampling (RS, n = 150) schemes. Average SOC concentration of the A-horizon from soil sampling area A, B, and C were 6.1, 7.1, 8.3 g kg − 1 , respectively. The mean A-horizon thickness for agricultural soils was 28 cm compared to 15 cm under adjacent grassland. Regression kriging was selected as prediction model where EC a  and local topographic information (i.e., slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, wetness index, altitude above channel network etc.) were used as predictors. We observed an increased SOC content, SOC stock, and A-horizon thickness with EC a  and wetness index. SOC from area B had the strongest spatial dependency (NSR = 0.64) followed by area A (NSR = 0.72), whereas that from area C was the weakest (NSR = 0.78). Compared to SOC content and A-horizon thickness prediction, SOC stocks prediction had the maximum uncertainty. Predicted SOC stock (t ha − 1 ) ranged from 28 for sampling area A to 40 for B, and 59 for area C. These high SOC stocks are the result of decade long intensive agriculture with high amount of nitrogen input and irrigation. It has resulted in deep A-horizon and high SOC stocks. This study found that SOC stocks in the Central Sands could be estimated from A-horizon thickness (R 2  {\~{}} 0.5).},

abstract = {Many areas in sub-Saharan African are data-poor and poorly accessible. The estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in these areas will have to rely on the limited available secondary data coupled with restricted field sampling. We assessed the total SOC stock, its spatial variation and the causes of this variation in Limpopo National Park (LNP), a data-poor and poorly accessible area in southwestern Mozambique. During a field survey, A-horizon thickness was measured and soil samples were taken for the determination of SOC concentrations. SOC concentrations were multiplied by soil bulk density and A-horizon thickness to estimate SOC stocks. Spatial distribution was assessed through: i) a measure-and-multiply approach to assess average SOC stocks by landscape unit, and ii) a soil-landscape model that used soil forming factors to interpolate SOC stocks from observations to a grid covering the area by ordinary (OK) and universal (UK) kriging. Predictions were validated by both independent and leave-one-out cross validations. The total SOC stock of the LNP was obtained by i) calculating an area-weighted average from the means of the landscape units and by ii) summing the cells of the interpolated grid. Uncertainty was evaluated by the mean standard error for the measure-and-multiply approach and by the mean kriging prediction standard deviation for the soil-landscape model approach. The reliability of the estimates of total stocks was assessed by the uncertainty of the input data and its effect on estimates. The mean SOC stock from all sample points is 1.59kgm-2; landscape unit averages are 1.13-2.46kgm-2. Covariables explained 45{\%} (soil) and 17{\%} (coordinates) of SOC stock variation. Predictions from spatial models averaged 1.65kgm-2 and are within the ranges reported for similar soils in southern Africa. The validation root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was about 30{\%} of the mean predictions for both OK and UK. Uncertainty is high (coefficient of variation of about 40{\%}) due to short-range spatial structure combined with sparse sampling. The range of total SOC stock of the 10,410km-2 study area was estimated at 15,579-17,908Gg. However, 90{\%} confidence limits of the total stocks estimated are narrower (5-15{\%}) for the measure-and-multiply model and wider (66-70{\%}) for the soil-landscape model. The spatial distribution is rather homogenous, suggesting levels are mainly determined by regional climate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil is central in the terrestrial ecosystem, linking and providing feedback responses to the other components, i.e., water, atmosphere, and vegetation. However, the role of soil in landscape evolution is usually not well acknowledged. In modeling landscape evolution, soil is only treated as a residue of weathering that is transported and redistributed along the hillslope. Weathering is considered as a process that produces clays and generates unconsolidated materials available for erosion. While pedology has been debating the form of qualitative factorial models for 75 years; models for soil water, heat, solute, gas and chemical reactions in a profile have matured. As soils are distributed continuously in three dimensions across landscapes, the profile models need to consider lateral fluxes. This review outlines the role of soil in landscape modeling. First, we review the role of soil in the current landscape evolution models. We then review data and models on soil weathering rates and transport processes. We discuss soil profile models that simulate soil formation processes, and combined soil-landscape evolution models. Finally we discuss how the models can be tested and validated in the real world and suggest how both soil scientists and landscape modelers can work together to address the grand challenges in modeling earth surface processes.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) content is considered as an important indicator of soil quality. An accurate spatial prediction of SOM content is so important for estimating soil organic carbon pool and monitoring change in it over time at a regional scale. Due to the unfavourable natural conditions in Tibetan Plateau, soil sampling with high density is time consuming and expensive. As a result, little research has focused on the spatial prediction of SOM content in Tibet because of shortage of data. We used a two-stage process that integrated an artificial neural network (ANN) and the estimation of its residuals by ordinary kriging to produce accurate SOM content maps based on sparsely distributed observations and available auxiliary information. SOM content data were obtained from a soil survey in Tibet and were used to train and validate the ANN-kriging methodology. Available environmental information including elevation, temperature, precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index were used as auxiliary variables in the ANN training. The prediction accuracy of SOM content was compared with those of ANN, universal kriging, and inverse distance weighting (IDW). A more accurate prediction of SOM content was obtained by ANN-kriging, with lower global prediction errors (root mean square error = 6.02 g kg-1) and higher Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (0.75) for validation sampling sites compared with other methods. Relative improvements of 26.94-37.10{\%} over other methods were observed in the prediction of SOM content. In conclusion, the proposed ANN-kriging methodology is particularly capable of improving the accuracy of SOM content mapping at large scale. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Explicit assessment of the uncertainties associated with environmental data, and their storage in a database, are therefore important. This paper presents a statistical framework for representing and simulating uncertain environmental variables. In general terms, an uncertain variable is completely specified by its probability distribution function (pdf). Pdfs are developed for objects with uncertain locations ('positional uncertainty') and uncertain attribute values ('attribute uncertainty'). Objects comprising multiple space-time locations are separated into 'rigid objects', where positional uncertainty cannot alter the internal geometry of the object, and 'deformable' objects, where positional uncertainty can vary between locations in one object. Statistical dependence is allowed between uncertainties in multiple locations in one object. The uncertainties associated with attribute values are also modelled with pdfs. The type and complexity of these pdfs depend upon the measurement scale and the space-time variability of the uncertain attribute. The framework is illustrated with examples. A prototype software tool for assessing uncertainties in environmental data, storing them within a database, and for generating realizations for use in Monte Carlo studies is also presented.},

The use of Remote Sensing data as secondary sources of information in digital soil mapping has been found to be cost effective and less time consuming compared to traditional soil mapping approaches. But the potentials of Remote Sensing data in improving knowledge of local scale soil information in West Africa have not been fully explored. This study investigated the use of high spatial resolution satellite data (RapidEye and Landsat), terrain/climatic data and laboratory analysed soil samples to map the spatial distribution of six soil properties–sand, silt, clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen–in a 580 km2 agricultural watershed in south-western Burkina Faso. Four statistical prediction models–multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB)–were tested and compared. Internal validation was conducted by cross validation while the predictions were validated against an independent set of soil samples considering the modelling area and an extrapolation area. Model performance statistics revealed that the machine learning techniques performed marginally better than the MLR, with the RFR providing in most cases the highest accuracy. The inability of MLR to handle non-linear relationships between dependent and independent variables was found to be a limitation in accurately predicting soil properties at unsampled locations. Satellite data acquired during ploughing or early crop development stages (e.g. May, June) were found to be the most important spectral predictors while elevation, temperature and precipitation came up as prominent terrain/climatic variables in predicting soil properties. The results further showed that shortwave infrared and near infrared channels of Landsat8 as well as soil specific indices of redness, coloration and saturation were prominent predictors in digital soil mapping. Considering the increased availability of freely available Remote Sensing data (e.g. Landsat, SRTM, Sentinels), soil information at local and regional scales in data poor regions such as West Africa can be improved with relatively little financial and human resources.

abstract = {This paper describes a software tool for: (1) assessing uncertainties in environmental data; and (2) generating realisations of uncertain data for use in uncertainty propagation analyses: the "Data Uncertainty Engine (DUE)". Data may be imported into DUE from file or from a database, and are represented in DUE as objects whose positions and attribute values may be uncertain. Objects supported by DUE include spatial vectors, spatial rasters, time-series of spatial data, simple time-series and objects that are constant in space and time. Attributes supported by DUE include continuous numerical variables (e.g. rainfall), discrete numerical variables (e.g. bird counts) and categorical variables (e.g. land-cover). Once data are imported, an uncertainty model can be developed for the positional and attribute uncertainties of environmental objects. This is currently limited to probability models, but confidence intervals and scenarios will be provided in the future. Using DUE, the spatial and temporal patterns of uncertainty (autocorrelation), as well as cross-correlations between related inputs, can be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis. Alongside expert judgement, sample data may be used to help estimate uncertainties, and to reduce the uncertainty of the simulated output by ensuring each realisation reproduces the sample data. Most importantly, DUE provides a conceptual framework for structuring an uncertainty analysis, allowing users without direct experience of uncertainty methods to develop realistic uncertainty models for their data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Regression-kriging (RK) is becoming an important tool in geostatistics because of the availability of many covariates at high spatial resolution with the advancement in proximal and remote-sensing with positioning technologies. This paper presents the application of a new local RK algorithm for prediction of soil properties. The algorithm was tested using 985 observations for prediction of soil pH, clay content and carbon content in the lower Hunter Valley of New South Wales in Australia. Environmental covariates for the area were compiled. First, the covariates used in regression analysis for each of the soil properties were obtained through a step-wise regression analysis. Secondly, different spatial prediction methods were examined. Finally, the prediction efficiency of various techniques was tested at validation sites using the standardised squared deviation as a measure of the goodness of theoretical estimates. The results from validation showed that the local RK method does not always present the best predictions, but for specific cases it may be highly accurate. We conclude that local RK performance depends on the actual soil and environmental factor relationships, and in general performs no worse than global RK. Furthermore, the advantage of local RK is that it can provide an approach to understand how much the regression models and variogram models change across a region. We have developed a software programme named RKGuider to carry out the local RK steps automatically. Further investigation and numerous datasets are required to verify the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The objective of the work presented in this paper was to investigate how rasters of the probabilities of occurrence of soil classes may be used to create digital soil property maps and maps of their associated uncertainties. The approach we present is formalised in an algorithm we developed called “Digital Soil Property Mapping Using Soil Class Probability Rasters” (PROPR). The soil class probability rasters were derived previously from a spatial disaggregation of the 1:250,000-scale Dalrymple Shire legacy soil polygon map from central Queensland, Australia. We created digital soil property maps of soil pH1:5 H2O and their uncertainties (as indicated by estimates of the limits of the 90{\%} prediction interval) at six depth increments down the soil profile (0–5cm, 5–15cm, 15–30cm, 30–60cm, 60–100cm, 100–200cm). The calculation of the weighted mean soil pH value for each depth increment at each grid cell was based on reference pH values for each soil class and used the probabilities of occurrence at each grid cell as weights. The calculation of the prediction interval limits for each depth increment involved sampling from the triangular distribution of the soil pH of each soil class using the soil class probabilities at each grid cell as weights in order to identify the number of samples to draw from each distribution. The 90{\%} prediction interval limits were then estimated as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of samples drawn from the soil classes' triangular distributions. The maps of soil pH displayed strong spatial patterns. Soil pH generally increased with depth. Uncertainty generally increased with depth. Validation on 300 randomly-selected soil profiles returned a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.193 at the surface increasing to 0.266 at depth. RMSE increased with depth from about 0.75pH units at the surface to 1.15 at depth. Soil class probability rasters are useful for generating digital soil property maps and maps of the associated uncertainties. Validation left room for improvement but the quality of the results is probably strongly affected by the quality of the spatial disaggregation that produced the soil class probability rasters. The PROPR approach may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. Generation of the soil class probability rasters to use in PROPR is a predictive exercise in itself and so is also subject to uncertainty. The probability rasters likely can be derived by several methods including logistic regression and data mining; the probability rasters we used were derived via spatial disaggregation of a legacy soil polygon map. PROPR may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. The soil class probability rasters need to be produced separately. Information on the within-soil-class variability of the target soil property at each depth increment must be known in order to establish the triangular distributions for the uncertainty estimation. PROPR may reduce reliance on having sufficient soil profile observations in areas where such data is limiting. We used available profile observations to estimate the within-soil-class variability in order to establish triangular distributions for the soil classes in our study area, but the information required to do so could also be derived from legacy reports or expert knowledge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. RESULTS: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. CONCLUSION: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

abstract = {Summary: There is an increasing demand for up-to-date soil organic carbon (OC) data for global environmental and climatic modelling. The aim of this study was to create a map of topsoil OC content at the European scale by applying digital soil mapping techniques to the first European harmonized geo-referenced topsoil (0-20 cm) database, which arises from the Land use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS). A map of the associated uncertainty was also produced to support careful use of the predicted OC contents. A generalized additive model (GAM) was fitted on 85{\%} of the dataset (R2 = 0.29), using OC content as dependent variable a backward stepwise approach selected slope, land cover, temperature, net primary productivity, latitude and longitude as suitable covariates. The validation of the model (performed on 15{\%} of the data-set) gave an overall R2 of 0.27 and an R2 of 0.21 for mineral soils and 0.06 for organic soils. Organic C content in most organic soils was under-predicted, probably because of the imposed unimodal distribution of our model, whose mean is tilted towards the prevalent mineral soils. This was also confirmed by the poor prediction in Scandinavia (where organic soils are more frequent), which gave an R2 of 0.09, whilst the prediction performance (R2) in non-Scandinavian countries was 0.28. The map of predicted OC content had the smallest values in Mediterranean countries and in croplands across Europe, whereas largest OC contents were predicted in wetlands, woodlands and mountainous areas. The map of the predictions' standard error had large uncertainty in northern latitudes, wetlands, moors and heathlands, whereas small uncertainty was mostly found in croplands. The map produced gives the most updated general picture of topsoil OC content at the European Union scale. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {This article reviews the use of optical and microwave remote sensing data for soil and terrain mapping with emphasis on applications at regional and coarser scales. Remote sensing is expected to offer possibilities for improving incomplete spatial and thematic coverage of current regional and global soil databases. Traditionally, remotely sensed imagery have been used to support segmentation of the landscape into rather homogeneous soil-landscape units for which soil composition can be established by sampling. Soil properties have also been inferred from optical and microwave data using physically-based and empirical methods. Used as a secondary data source, remotely sensed imagery may support spatial interpolation of sparsely sampled soil property data. Soil properties that have been measured using remote or proximal sensing approaches include mineralogy, texture, soil iron, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil salinity and carbonate content. In sparsely vegetated areas, successful use of space borne, airborne, and in situ measurements using optical, passive and active microwave instruments has been reported. On the other hand, in densely vegetated areas, soil data acquisition typically relied on indirect retrievals using soil indicators, such as plant functional groups, productivity changes, and Ellenberg indicator values. Several forms of kriging, classification and regression tree analyses have been used jointly with remotely sensed data to predict soil properties at unvisited locations aiming at obtaining continuous area coverage. We expect that remotely sensed data from existing platforms and planned missions can provide an important data source supporting digital soil mapping. Yet, most studies so far have been performed on a local scale and only few on regional or smaller map scale. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal properties of existing data sources. For example, space borne spectroscopy has been of limited use in retrieving soil data when compared to laboratory or field spectroscopy. To date, there is no coherent methodology established, where approaches of spatial segmentation, measurements of soil properties and interpolation using remotely sensed data are integrated in a holistic fashion to achieve complete area coverage. Such approaches will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for digital soil mapping. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work we aimed at developing a conceptual framework in which we improve our understanding of the controlling factors for soil organic carbon (SOC) over vast areas at different depths. We postulated that variability in SOC levels may be better explained by modeling SOC within soil-landscape systems (SLSs). The study was performed in mainland France, and explanatory SOC models were developed for the sampled topsoil (0-30 cm) and subsoil ({\textgreater}30 cm), using both directed and undirected data-mining techniques. With this study we demonstrated that there is a shift in controlling factors both in space and depth which were mainly related to (1) typical SLS characteristics and (2) human-induced changes to SLSs. The controlling factors in relation to depth alter from predominantly biotic to more abiotic with increasing depth. Especially, water availability, soil texture, and physical protection control deeper stored SOC. In SLSs with similar SOC levels, different combinations of physical protection, the input of organic matter, and climatic conditions largely determined the SOC level. The SLS approach provided the means to partition the data into data sets that were having homogenous conditions with respect to this combination of controlling factors. This information may provide important information on the carbon storage and sequestration potential of a soil.},

abstract = {The measurement of soil erodibility (K) in the field is tedious, time-consuming and expensive; therefore, its prediction through pedotransfer functions (PTFs) could be far less costly and time-consuming. The aim of this study was to develop new PTFs to estimate the K factor using multiple linear regression, Mamdani fuzzy inference systems, and artificial neural networks. For this purpose, K was measured in 40 erosion plots with natural rainfall. Various soil properties including the soil particle size distribution, calcium carbonate equivalent, organic matter, permeability, and wet-aggregate stability were measured. The results showed that the mean measured K was 0.014 t h MJ− 1 mm− 1 and 2.08 times less than the estimated mean K (0.030 t h MJ− 1 mm− 1) using the USLE model. Permeability, wet-aggregate stability, very fine sand, and calcium carbonate were selected as independent variables by forward stepwise regression in order to assess the ability of multiple linear regression, Mamdani fuzzy inference systems and artificial neural networks to predict K. The calcium carbonate equivalent, which is not accounted for in the USLE model, had a significant impact on K in multiple linear regression due to its strong influence on the stability of aggregates and soil permeability. Statistical indices in validation and calibration datasets determined that the artificial neural networks method with the highest R2, lowest RMSE, and lowest ME was the best model for estimating the K factor. A strong correlation (R2 = 0.81, n = 40, p {\textless} 0.05) between the estimated K from multiple linear regression and measured K indicates that the use of calcium carbonate equivalent as a predictor variable gives a better estimation of K in areas with calcareous soils.},

abstract = {Conventional soil mapping is costly and time consuming. Therefore, the development of quick, cheap, but accurate methods is required. Several studies highlight the importance of developing regional soil spectral libraries for digital soil mapping, but few studies report on the use of these libraries to aid digital mapping of soil types. This study aims to produce a digital soil map using as training set Visible and Near Infra-Red (Vis-NIR) spectra from local soil samples, a regional spectral library and terrain attributes. The soils were sampled in 162 locations on a 270-ha farm in the municipality of Piracicaba, S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. Spectra from topsoil and subsoil were measured in laboratory (400-2500 nm) and arranged as multi-depth spectra. Information was summarized by principal component analysis. Regression tree models were calibrated to predict principal components (PC) scores based on terrain attributes. After calibration, the models were applied to the entire study site, resulting in PC score maps. Fuzzy c-means and PC maps were used to define the soil mapping units (MU). Based on fuzzy centroids, representative samples (RS) were defined to the MU. Munsell soil color and soil order were predicted from soil spectra and used to characterize the MU. The regression tree model had a good fit for PC1, with an r2 of 0.92, and a satisfactory r2 for PC3, PC4, and PC5, respectively 0.58, 0.66 and 0.53. The fuzzy clustering defined seven MU. The R2 for Munsell color predictions were 0.94 (hue), 0.96 (value) and 0.73 (chroma). Soil order had good agreement in validation, with kappa coefficient of 0.41. The methodology indicates the potential of Vis-NIR spectra to improve soil mapping campaigns and consequently provides a product similar to a conventional soil map.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the quantity and quality of the material lost by soil erosion due to soil management is a basic need to identify land management zones in catchments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil management on the quantity and quality of soil material lost by erosion in the Posses sub-watershed, Municipality of Extrema, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Water and sediments lost by natural rainfall erosion were sampled from erosion plots located on a Red-Yellow Argisol (PVA) under the following systems: bare soil, subsistence farming (maize/beans/pumpkin/jack-beans/fallow), degraded pasture, well-managed pasture, and reforestation set up in 2013; and in a Argisol: reforestation set up in 2008, bare soil, and native forest. Ca, Mg, K, P, N and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were determined in sediment and soil samples (at 0-5 cm depth) for the determination of the runoff enrichment ratios. Management influences soil losses more so than water losses. Minor losses were found in reforestation set up in 2013 (soil); in well-managed pasture (water); and in reforestations (nutrients and SOM). These losses tend to stability with time. The general sequence of nutrient losses was N  {\textgreater}  Ca  {\textgreater}  Mg  {\textgreater}  K  {\textgreater}  P in PVA; and N  {\textgreater}  Ca  {\textgreater}  K  {\textgreater}  Mg  {\textgreater}  P in Argisol. Loss rates of SOM and N followed the order: bare soil  {\textgreater}  subsistence farming  {\textgreater}  degraded pasture  {\textgreater}  well-managed pasture  {\textgreater}  reforestation, in PVA; and bare soil  {\textgreater}  native forest  {\textgreater}  reforestation, in Argisol. Reforestation and wellmanagement pasture are effective conservation strategies in order to lower the erosion process in the Posses sub-watershed. Soil losses, as well as nutrients and organic matter losses were more influenced by soil management than water losses. The safeguarding native forest under Argisol is essential to the conservation of this pedoenvironment, especially in steep slopes.},

abstract = {Spatial information on soil properties is an important input to hydrological models. In current hydrological modelling practices, soil property information is often derived from soil category maps by the linking method in which a representative soil property value is linked to each soil polygon. Limited by the area-class nature of soil category maps, the derived soil property variation is discontinuous and less detailed than high resolution digital terrain or remote sensing data. This research proposed dmSoil, a data-mining-based approach to derive continuous and spatially detailed soil property information from soil category maps. First, the soil-environment relationships are extracted through data mining of a soil map. The similarity of the soil at each location to different soil types in the soil map is then estimated using the mined relationships. Prediction of soil property values at each location is made by combining the similarities of the soil at that location to different soil types and the representative soil property values of these soil types. The new approach was applied in the Raffelson Watershed and Pleasant Valley in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, United States to map soil A horizon texture (in both areas) and depth to soil C horizon (in Pleasant Valley). The property maps from the dmSoil approach capture the spatial gradation and details of soil properties better than those from the linking method. The new approach also shows consistent accuracy improvement at validation points. In addition to the improved performances, the inputs for the dmSoil approach are easy to prepare, and the approach itself is simple to deploy. It provides an effective way to derive better soil property information from soil category maps for hydrological modelling. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Rainfall erosivity is the capability of rainfall to cause soil loss from hillslopes by water. Modern definitions of rainfall erosivity began with the development of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), where rainfall characteristics were statistically related to soil loss from thousands of plot-years of natural rainfall and runoff data. USLE erosivity combines the energy of the rainfall and the maximum continuous 30-min intensity in the event. Energy of rainfall is estimated as a function of the storm intensity through the rainfall event. The USLE erosivity has been used effectively for conservation planning purposes for more than 5 decades. When the USLE was replaced by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), a new energy-intensity equation was adopted. The new equation was not extensively tested prior to adoption, leads to significant under-predictions of erosivity, and was later replaced in RUSLE2. The RUSLE energy-intensity equation is no longer recommended by the RUSLE and RUSLE2 development teams. RUSLE2 also introduced the concept of erosivity density, which resulted in significant improvements in the calculations and mapping of rainfall erosivity. Calculations of erosivity as a whole are entirely based on rainfall intensities, and erosivity is an empirically-based index. The science indicates that the direct role of kinetic energy of rainfall as the driver of hillslope erosion in all cases is not warranted by the overall evidence, because many times the kinetic energy of raindrops is not the driving force behind rill erosion. The USLE erosivity empirically explains much of the variance in the soil loss from natural rainfall erosion plots.},

abstract = {Water erosion negatively affects soil fertility, soil structure, and water availability to plants. Moreover, off-site erosion effects contribute to the sedimentation and eutrophication of water courses. The Grande River is one of the main tributaries of the Paran{\'{a}} River, and an important source of hydroelectric power in Brazil. The Upper Grande River Basin covers an area of 15,705 km2, mostly occupied by rangelands. Shallow and little permeable Cambisols are the predominant soil class in the basin, which, combined with the intensive and highly concentrated summer rainfall, characterize an erosion-prone scenario. The aim of this study was to model the soil losses and the sediment yield in the Upper Grande River Basin. It also sought to quantify the sediment delivery to the two main hydroelectric power plant reservoirs in the basin: Camargos/Itutinga and Funil. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were used to apply the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Sediment Delivery Distributed model (SEDD) in the study area. The models were calibrated using sediment transport data obtained from a river gauging station located in a subwatershed. RUSLE predictions estimated that the average soil losses in the Upper Grande River Basin were of 22.35 t ha− 1 yr− 1, and that bare soils, eucalypt and agriculture suffered the highest erosion rates among the identified land use classes. The average specific sediment yield in the basin was of 1.93 t ha− 1 yr− 1. According to the model calibration, the specific sediment yield predictions showed an error of 0.01 t ha− 1 yr− 1, or 0.6{\%}. Agriculture and eucalypt forests, which compose approximately 10{\%} of the study area, contribute to more than 40{\%} of the sediment yield in the basin. The model predictions estimated that 1.45 million t yr− 1 of sediments are delivered to the Camargos/Itutinga power plant reservoir, whereas the Funil power plant reservoir receives a sediment input of 1.68 million t yr− 1. Although model calibration yielded small errors in relation to the observed sediment measurements, the relative lack of available data has impaired a more thorough validation of the employed models. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the RUSLE/SEDD approach may be useful for analyzing sediment transport in Brazilian watersheds, where limited input data is available.},

abstract = {The paper describes a framework for modeling dynamic soil properties in 3-dimensions and time (3D + T) using soil data collected with automated sensor networks as a case study. Two approaches to geostatistical modeling and spatio-temporal predictions are described: (1) 3D + T predictive modeling using random forests algorithms, and (2) 3D + T kriging model after detrending the observations for depth-dependent seasonal effects. All the analyses used data from the Cook Agronomy Farm (37 ha), which includes hourly measurements of soil volumetric water content, temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity at 42 stations and five depths (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m), collected over five years. This data set also includes 2- and 3-dimensional, temporal, and spatio-temporal covariates covering the same area. The results of (strict) leave-one-station-out cross-validation indicate that both models accurately predicted soil temperature, while predictive power was lower for water content, and lowest for electrical conductivity. The kriging model explained 37{\%}, 96{\%}, and 18{\%} of the variability in water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity respectively versus 34{\%}, 93{\%}, and 5{\%} explained by the random forests model. A less rigorous simple cross-validation of the random forests model indicated improved predictive power when at least some data were available for each station, explaining 86{\%}, 97{\%}, and 88{\%} of the variability in water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity respectively. The high difference between the strict and simple cross-validation indicates high temporal auto-correlation of values at measurement stations. Temporal model components (i.e. day of the year and seasonal trends) explained most of the variability in observations in both models for all three variables. The seamless predictions of 3D + T data produced from this analysis can assist in understanding soil processes and how they change through a season, under different land management scenarios, and how they relate to other environmental processes.},

In this respect, low frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI) has been widely used to measure soil apparent electrical conductivity. However, the potential to model soil subsurface layering has not been fully realized using EMI data. In this paper, we applied a probabilistic optimization approach, namely DREAM (ZS), on Geonics EM38 data to explore the robustness of this approach for soil subsurface conductivity mapping. The EM38 data was measured from the Ardakan region in the province of Yazd located in central Iran. Several soil samples were taken and were further analyzed in a laboratory to derive soil textural and physical parameters. The probabilistic inversion was performed in a joint multi-configuration framework considering a five layered model. The estimated values are mainly in agreement with the clay map (as the most influential factor); nevertheless, soil salinity data and inversely estimated conductivity values are poorly correlated for deeper layers due to the aridic condition and high clay content in the study area. DREAM (ZS) optimization approach appears to be promising for accurate retrieval of soil conductivity depth profile from EM38 data.},

abstract = {Mapping and immediate forecasting of soil water content ($\theta$) and its movement can be challenging. Although inversion of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by electromagnetic induction to calculate depth-specific electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) has been used, it is difficult to apply it across a field. In this paper we use a calibration established along a transect, across a 3.94-ha field with varying soil texture, using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to monitor and nowcast the 3-dimensional $\theta$ dynamics on 16 separate days over a period of 38 days. The EnKF combined a physical model fitted with $\theta$ measured by soil moisture sensors and an Artificial Neural Network model comprising $\sigma$ generated by quasi-3d inversions of DUALEM-421S ECa data. Results showed that the distribution of $\theta$ was controlled by soil texture, topography, and vegetation. Soil water dried fastest at the beginning after the initial irrigation event and decreased with time and soil depth, which was consistent with classical soil drying theory and experiments. It was also found that the soil dried fastest in the loamy and duplex soils present in the field, which was attributable to deep drainage and preferential flow. It was concluded that the EnKF approach can be used to improve the irrigation efficiency by applying variable irrigation rates across the field. In addition, soil water status can be nowcasted across large spatial extents using this method with weather forecast information, which will provide guidance to farmers for real-time irrigation management.},

abstract = {This work presents the first high-resolution map of soil organic carbon (SOC) in mainland France, including soils below 30. cm. The research was performed within the framework of GlobalSoilMap (GSM). SOC predictions for different depth layers (0-5. cm, 5-15. cm, 15-30. cm, 30-60. cm, 60-100. cm and {\textgreater}. 100. cm) were made at 90 and 500. m resolution for mainland France, along with their upper and lower confidence intervals. The maps were developed using data mining and an elaborate cross-validation scheme. The 90. m maps were compared to 500. m resolution GlobalSoilMap maps and the SoilGrids1km (SG1km) product. The latter is a global model for predicting soil properties for the same depth layers, at 1. km resolution.At 90 and 500. m resolution, the predicted SOC content was unbiased and showed good agreement with the measured SOC, despite the poor model diagnostics and decrease of performance with depth. It was found that the subsoil ({\textgreater}. 30. cm) carbon pool for France contributes 49{\%} to the total soil carbon stock. The use of coarser resolution prediction grids resulted in smoother spatial patterns and wider confidence intervals; however, it did not bias the estimated carbon stocks. Applying GlobalSoilMap specifications to France, using a large soil dataset and all the exhaustive spatially available data outperformed SG1km predictions. The overall spatial patterns of the SG1km SOC content were found to be very similar to the GlobalSoilMap maps. However, the SG1km overestimated the SOC content and carbon stocks ({\textgreater}. 75{\%} for the total carbon stock, and 100{\%} for the stocks below 30. cm) and showed a similar spatial distribution over the different soil depth layers. The main reason for the overestimation was that the local data used in SG1km was rather small (56 samples) and not representative in terms of SOC content or represented soil types; the profiles had far higher SOC content and this may have propagated in the modelled vertical profile and the kriging part of the residuals. Improvements for SG1km may entail the use of a representative national subsample from large national soil databases. Furthermore, a bottom-up approach such as GlobalSoilMap may be more favourable when considering prediction accuracies, data privacy policies and local acceptance of generated products.},

abstract = {Existing sample data are important for digital soil mapping. Different sample points possess different representativeness. The representativeness of samples influences the soil mapping result greatly. However, few study focus on assessing the representativeness of single sample. In this paper, we proposed a method to identify representative samples from existing samples collected from multiple resources. The basic idea of the method was to use clusters of environmental covariates to approximate types of soil variations, and check the occupancy of the existing samples in centroids of environmental clusters. Those samples locating in typical locations or centroids of environmental clusters were considered as representative samples. In this paper, the proposed method was used to discern representative samples in 282 soil samples in Anhui Province, China. SOM content was mapped using a similarity based mapping method. Two cases with different training samples (representative samples, non-representative samples, and training samples including representative and non-representative samples) and validation samples were set to compare the mapping results and accuracies. The results showed that the SOM content maps predicted using representative training samples had generally higher accuracy than the results produced using non-representative samples, and comparative accuracies with the results produced using full training samples. To discern representative samples is helpful for understanding the soil-landscape relationships in an area and the proposed method can be used to design supplementary samples for a better soil mapping result. Mapping results and accuracies showed that different training and validation sample sets impacted the mapping results and accuracies greatly, which indicates that researchers should be cautious when using randomization to obtain training and validation subsets for soil mapping.},

Six data mining techniques namely; artificial neural networks, support vector regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forests, regression tree models, and genetic programming were combined with equal-area smoothing splines to develop, evaluate and compare their effectiveness in achieving this aim. Using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 188 soil profiles in the study area were sampled and soil organic carbon content (SOC) measured. Eighteen ancillary data variables derived from a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 images were used to represent predictive soil forming factors in this study area. Findings showed that normalized difference vegetation index and wetness index were the most useful ancillary data for SOC mapping in the upper (0-15cm) and bottom (60-100cm) of soil profiles, respectively. According to 5-fold cross-validation, artificial neural networks (ANN) showed the highest performance for prediction of SOC in the four standard depths compared to all other data mining techniques. ANNs resulted in the lowest root mean square error and highest Lin's concordance coefficient which ranged from 0.07 to 0.20 log (kg/m3) and 0.68 to 0.41, respectively, with the first value in each range being for the top of the profile and second for the bottom. Furthermore, ANNs increased performance of spatial prediction compared to the other data mining algorithms by up to 36, 23, 21 and 13{\%} for each soil depth, respectively, starting from the top of the profile. Overall, results showed that prediction of subsurface SOC variation needs improvement and the challenge remains to find appropriate covariates that can explain it.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key element of agroecosystems functioning and has a crucial impact on global carbon storage. At the landscape scale, SOC spatial variability is strongly affected by natural and anthropogenic processes and linear anthropogenic elements (such hedges or ditches). This study aims at mapping SOC stocks distribution in the A-horizons for a depth up to 105cm, at a high spatial resolution, for an area of 10km2 in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape (North-Western France). We used a data mining tool, Cubist, to build rule-based predictive models and predict SOC content and soil bulk density (BD) from a calibration dataset at 8 standard layers (0 to 7.5cm, 7.5 to 15cm, 15 to 30cm, 30 to 45cm, 45 to 60cm, 60 to 75cm, 75 to 90cm and 90 to 105cm). For the models calibration, 70 sampling locations were selected within the whole study area using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method. Two independent validation datasets were used to assess the performance of the predictive models: (i) at landscape scale, 49 sampling locations were selected using stratified random sampling based on a 300-m square grid; (ii) at hedge vicinity, 112 sampling locations were selected along transects perpendicular to 14 purposively chosen hedges. Undisturbed samples were collected at fixed depths and analysed for BD and SOC content at each sampling location and continuous soil profiles were reconstructed using equal-area splines. Predictive environmental data consisted in attributes derived from a light detection and ranging digital elevation model (LiDAR DEM), geological variables, land use data and a predictive map of A-horizon thickness. Considering the two validation datasets (at landscape scale and hedge vicinity), root mean square errors (RMSE) of the predictions, computed for all the standard soil layers (up to a depth of 105cm), were respectively 7.74 and 5.02gkg-1 for SOC content, and 0.15 and 0.21gcm-3 for BD. Best predictions were obtained for layers between 15 and 60cm of depth. The SOC stocks were calculated over a depth of 105cm by combining the prediction of SOC content and BD. The final maps show that the carbon stocks in the soil below 30cm accounted for 33{\%} of the total SOC stocks on average. The whole method produced consistent results between the two predicted soil properties. The final SOC stocks maps provide continuous data along soil profile up to 105cm, which may be critical information for supporting carbon policy and management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation that causes soil densification and distortion that can lead to changes in three-dimensional soil structure variability. For this reason we proposed a method for mapping compaction in three-dimensional space (3D), based on simple soil-specific depth functions. This method, denoted the 'top down' method, is based on a multi-step approach that starts with a framework for selecting the best depth function, considers which shape best describes the soil-specific variation by depth and ends with an interpolation of the coefficients of the function across the field. Subsequently, for each interpolated point this function is solved in order to estimate compaction in 3D space. The top down method was evaluated using a cone resistance dataset, collected at the CULS (Czech University of Life Sciences) farm in Lany. The accuracy of this method in predicting cone-index variation in the 3D space was compared with the generally accepted 3D ordinary kriging interpolation, using descriptive statistics of the predicted values and cross validation. We found that the top down method better represented observed information and generally performs better than 3D kriging with a far smaller sample size. The cross validation results suggest that ordinary kriging can predict cone-index obtaining a value of root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 0.54 at 10{\%} soil profiles excluded, and 0.57 at 50{\%} exclusion; on the contrary the top down mapping method obtains an RMSD value of just 0.47, at 10{\%} exclusion, and 0.53, with 50{\%} exclusion. We also found that the depth function method was more representative of the observed variability in the predicted dataset, avoiding the smoothing filtering effect typical of kriging interpolation. We then created a cone-index map of the CULS Lany field with a vertical resolution of 10. cm using the top down method. The map can be seen as a series of three videos where it is possible to observe the cone-index pattern in three-dimensions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil C is the largest pool of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere, and yet the processes of C accumulation, transformation and loss are poorly accounted for. This, in part, is due to the fact that soil C is not uniformly distributed through the soil depth profile and most current landscape level predictions of C do not adequately account the vertical distribution of soil C. In this study, we apply a method based on simple soil specific depth functions to map the soil C stock in three-dimensions at landscape scale. We used soil C and bulk density data from the Soil Survey for England and Wales to map an area in the West Midlands region of approximately 13,948km2. We applied a method which describes the variation through the soil profile and interpolates this across the landscape using well established soil drivers such as relief, land cover and geology. The results indicate that this mapping method can effectively reproduce the observed variation in the soil profiles samples. The mapping results were validated using cross validation and an independent validation. The cross-validation resulted in an R2 of 36{\%} for soil C and 44{\%} for BULKD. These results are generally in line with previous validated studies. In addition, an independent validation was undertaken, comparing the predictions against the National Soil Inventory (NSI) dataset. The majority of the residuals of this validation are between ±5{\%} of soil C. This indicates high level of accuracy in replicating topsoil values. In addition, the results were compared to a previous study estimating the carbon stock of the UK. We discuss the implications of our results within the context of soil C loss factors such as erosion and the impact on regional C process models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil is very important for many land functions. To achieve sustainability it is important to understand how soils vary over space in the landscape. Remote sensing data can be instrumental in mapping and spatial modelling of soil properties, resources and their variability. The aims of this study were to compare satellite sensors (MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) with varying spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) of a set of soil properties in Scotland, evaluate the potential benefits of adding Sentinel-1 data to DSM models, select the most suited mix of sensors for DSM to map the considered set of soil properties and validate the results of topsoil (2D) and whole profile (3D) models. The results showed that the use of a mixture of sensors proved more effective to model and map soil properties than single sensors. The use of radar Sentinel-1 data proved useful for all soil properties, improving the prediction capability of models with only optical bands. The use of MODIS time series provided stronger relationships than the use of temporal snapshots. The results showed good validation statistics with a RMSE below 20{\%} of the range for all considered soil properties. The RMSE improved from previous studies including only MODIS sensor and using a coarser prediction grid. The performance of the models was similar to previous studies at regional, national or continental scale. A mix of optical and radar data proved useful to map soil properties along the profile. The produced maps of soil properties describing both lateral and vertical variability, with associated uncertainty, are important for further modelling and management of soil resources and ecosystem services. Coupled with further data the soil properties maps could be used to assess soil functions and therefore conditions and suitability of soils for a range of purposes.},

abstract = {Visible near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (vis–NIR) is an increasingly popular measurement method that can provide cheaper and faster predictions of soil properties, including soil organic carbon content (SOC). The spectroscopic prediction method relies significantly on the development of regressions of data in spectral databases or libraries. While the vis–NIR estimation of SOC was developed in controlled laboratory conditions, its natural development in recent years has been to perform the vis–NIR measurements in situ, where soil spectra are recorded under field conditions. However, environmental factors, such as soil moisture content, have been shown to affect soil spectra, making the use of regressions derived using soil spectral libraries difficult. Direct standardization (DS) and external parameter orthogonalisation (EPO) are two methods that were proposed for the correction of variable moisture conditions and other environmental factors. In this study, we compared DS and EPO on a set of 150 soil samples (3 depths from each of 50 soil cores) from a farm in New Zealand. The samples were re-wetted under controlled conditions, and spectra were recorded at nine different moisture levels. Our results show that DS and EPO are two effective strategies to mitigate the effects of soil water content on vis–NIR spectra. While DS and EPO results were similar when a large number of soil cores were reserved for calibrating the moisture correction methods, SOC predictions using the EPO correction significantly outperformed those using the DS correction for a lower number of cores (5 cores, 15 samples).},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are required to quantify carbon sources and sinks caused by land use change at national scale. This study presents a novel robust kriging method to precisely estimate regional and national mean SOC stocks, along with truthful standard errors. We used this new approach to estimate mean forest SOC stock for Switzerland and for its five main ecoregions. Using data of 1033 forest soil profiles, we modelled stocks of two compartments (0-30, 0-100 cm depth) of mineral soils. Log-normal regression models that accounted for correlation between SOC stocks and environmental covariates and residual (spatial) auto-correlation were fitted by a newly developed robust restricted maximum likelihood method, which is insensitive to outliers in the data. Precipitation, near-infrared reflectance, topographic and aggregated information of a soil and a geotechnical map were retained in the models. Both models showed weak but significant residual autocorrelation. The predictive power of the fitted models, evaluated by comparing predictions with independent data of 175 soil profiles, was moderate (robust R-2 = 0.34 for SOC stock in 0-30 cm and R-2 = 0.40 in 0-100 cm). Prediction standard errors (SE), validated by comparing point prediction intervals with data, proved to be conservative. Using the fitted models, we mapped forest SOC stock by robust external-drift point kriging at high resolution across Switzerland. Predicted mean stocks in 0-30 and 0100 cm depth were equal to 7.99 kg m(-2) (SE 0.15 kg m(-2)) and 12.58 kg m(-2) (SE 0.24 kg m(-2)), respectively. Hence, topsoils store about 64{\%} of SOC stocks down to 100 cm depth. Previous studies underestimated SOC stocks of topsoil slightly and those of subsoils strongly. The comparison further revealed that our estimates have substantially smaller SE than previous estimates.},

abstract = {The quantification and the spatialisation of reliable SOC stocks (Mg C ha− 1) and total stock (Tg C) baselines and associated uncertainties are fundamental to detect the gains or losses in SOC, and to locate sensitive areas with low SOC levels. Here, we aim to both quantify and spatialize SOC stocks at regional scale (southern Belgium) based on data from one non-design-based or model-based sampling scheme. To this end, we developed a computation procedure based on Digital Soil Mapping techniques and stochastic simulations (Monte-Carlo) allowing the estimation of multiple (here, 10,000) independent spatialized datasets. The computation of the prediction uncertainty accounts for the errors associated to both the estimations of i) SOC stocks and ii) parameters of the spatial model. Based on these 10,000 individuals, median SOC stocks and 90{\%} prediction intervals were computed for each pixel, as well as total SOC stocks and their 90{\%} prediction intervals for selected sub-areas and for the entire study area. Hence, a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) explaining 69.3{\%} of the SOC stock variance was calibrated and then validated (R2 = 0.64). The model overestimated low SOC stock (below 50 Mg C ha− 1) and underestimated high SOC stock (especially those above 100 Mg C kg− 1). A positive gradient of SOC stock occurred from the northwest to the center of Wallonia with a slight decrease on the southernmost part, correlating to the evolution of precipitation and temperature (along with elevation) and dominant land use. At the catchment scale higher SOC stocks were predicted on valley bottoms, especially for poorly drained soils under grassland. Mean predicted SOC stocks for cropland and grassland in Wallonia were of 26.58 Tg C (SD 1.52) and 43.30 Tg C (2.93), respectively. The procedure developed here allowed to predict realistic spatial patterns of SOC stocks all over agricultural lands of southern Belgium and to produce reliable statistics of total SOC stocks for each of the 20 combinations of land use/agricultural regions of Wallonia. This procedure appears useful to produce soil maps as policy tools in conducting sustainable management at regional and national scales, and to compute statistics which comply with specific requirements of reporting activities.},

@article{Gomes2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved. Computer models have been used to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change. Commonly, models require to determine soil bulk density (D b ), a variable that is often lacking in soil data bases. To partly overcome this problem, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are developed to estimate D b from other easily available soil properties. However, only a few studies have determined the accuracy of these functions and quantified their effects on the final quality of the spatial variability maps. In this context, the objectives of this study were: i) to develop one PTF to estimate D b in soils of the Brazilian Central Amazon region; ii) to compare the performance of PTFs generated with three other models generally used to estimate D b in soils of the Amazon region; and iii) to quantify the effect of applying these PTFs on the spatial variability maps of SOC stock. Using data from 96 soil profiles in the Urucu river basin in Brazil, a multiple linear regression model was generated to estimate D b using SOC, pH, sum of basic cations, aluminum (Al +3 ), and clay content. This model outperformed the three other PTFs published in the literature. The average estimation error of SOC stock using our model was 0.03 Mg C ha -1 , which is markedly lower than the other PTFs (1.06 and 1.23 Mg C ha -1 , or 15 {\%} and 17 {\%}, respectively). Thus, the application of a non-validated PTF to estimate D b can introduce an error that is large enough to skew the significant difference in soil carbon stock change.},

abstract = {Soils from the remote areas of the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil are poorly mapped due to the presence of dense forest and lack of access routes. The use of covariates derived from multispectral and radar remote sensors allows mapping large areas and has the potential to improve the accuracy of soil attribute maps. The objectives of this study were to: (a) evaluate the addition of relief, and vegetation covariates derived from multispectral images with distinct spatial and spectral resolutions (Landsat 8 and RapidEye) and L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) for the prediction of soil organic carbon stock (CS) and particle size fractions; and (b) evaluate the performance of four geostatistical methods to map these soil properties. Overall, the results show that, even under forest coverage, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ALOS PALSAR backscattering coefficient improved the accuracy of CS and subsurface clay content predictions. The NDVI derived from RapidEye sensor improved the prediction of CS using isotopic cokriging, while the NDVI derived from Landsat 8 and backscattering coefficient were selected to predict clay content at the subsurface using regression kriging (RK). The relative improvement of applying cokriging and RK over ordinary kriging were lower than 10{\%}, indicating that further analyses are necessary to connect soil proxies (vegetation and relief types) with soil attributes.},

abstract = {Most calibration sampling designs for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) demarcate spatially distinct sample sites. In practical applications major challenges are often limited field accessibility and the question on how to integrate legacy soil samples to cope with usually scarce resources for field sampling and laboratory analysis. The study focuses on the development and application of an efficiency improved DSM sampling design that (1) applies an optimized sample set size, (2) compensates for limited field accessibility, and (3) enables the integration of legacy soil samples. The proposed sampling design represents a modification of conditioned Latin Hypercube Sam- pling (cLHS), which originally returns distinct sample sites to optimally cover a soil related covari- ate space and to preserve the correlation of the covariates in the sample set. The sample set size was determined by comparing multiple sample set sizes of original cLHS sets according to their representation of the covariate space. Limited field accessibility and the integration of leg- acy samples were incorporated by providing alternative sample sites to replace the original cLHS sites. We applied the modified cLHS design (cLHSadapt) in a small catchment (4.2 km2)in Central China to model topsoil sand fractions using Random Forest regression (RF). For evaluat- ing the proposed approach, we compared cLHSadapt with the original cLHS design (cLHSorig). With an optimized sample set size n = 30, the results show a similar representation of the cLHS covariate space between cLHSadapt and cLHSorig, while the correlation between the covariates is preserved (r = 0.40 vs. r = 0.39). Furthermore, we doubled the sample set size of cLHSadapt by adding available legacy samples (cLHSadapt+) and compared the prediction accuracies. Based on an external validation set cLHSval (n = 20), the coefficient of determination (R2) of the cLHSadapt predictions range between 0.59 and 0.71 for topsoil sand fractions. The R2-values of the RF predictions based on cLHSadapt+, using additional legacy samples, are marginally in- creased on average by 5{\%}},

abstract = {Quantitative estimates of forage availability at the end of the growing season in rangelands are helpful for pastoral livestock managers and for local, national and regional stakeholders in natural resource management. For this reason, remote sensing data such as the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) have been widely used to assess Sahelian plant productivity for about 40 years. This study combines traditional FAPAR-based assessments with agrometeorological variables computed by the geospatial water balance program, GeoWRSI, using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration satellite gridded data to estimate the annual herbaceous yield in the semi-arid areas of Senegal. It showed that a machine-learning model combining FAPAR seasonal metrics with various agrometeorological data provided better estimations of the in situ annual herbaceous yield (R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 483 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) than models based exclusively on FAPAR metrics (R2 = 0.63; RMSE = 550 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) or agrometeorological variables (R2 = 0.55; RMSE = 585 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha). All the models provided reasonable outputs and showed a decrease in the mean annual yield with increasing latitude, together with an increase in relative inter-annual variation. In particular, the additional use of agrometeorological information mitigated the saturation effects that characterize the plant indices of areas with high plant productivity. In addition, the date of the onset of the growing season derived from smoothed FAPAR seasonal dynamics showed no significant relationship (0.05 p-level) with the annual herbaceous yield across the whole studied area. The date of the onset of rainfall however, was significantly related to the herbaceous yield and its inclusion in fodder biomass models could constitute a significant improvement in forecasting risks of a mass herbaceous deficit at an early stage of the year.

High-resolution WorldView-2 data, TerraSAR-X intensity data, medium-resolution ASTER spectral bands and indices, as well as ENVISAT ASAR intensity and SRTM-X-derived topographic parameters served as input features. Objects were derived from image segmentation. The classification of the image objects was conducted applying a nonlinear support vector machine approach. With the recursive feature elimination approach, the most input-relevant features for separating the target classes were selected. Despite multiple target classes, an overall accuracy of 71.9{\%} was achieved. Inaccuracies occurred between classes with high CaCO3 content and between classes of silica-rich substrates. The incorporation of different input feature datasets improved the classification accuracy. An in-depth interpretation of the classification result was conducted with three soil profile transects.},

Spatial distributions of topsoil carbon, ni- trogen and available phosphorus in mountain regionswere identified using supervised learningmethods, and a functional landscape analysiswas performed in order to determine the spatial soil fertility pattern for the Soyang Lakewatershed in South Korea. Specific research aimswere (1) to identify important predictors; (2) to develop digital soilmaps; (3) to assess land potentials using digital soilmaps. Soil profiles and sampleswere collected by conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling considering operational field constraints such as accessibility and no-go areas contaminated by landmines as well as budget limitations. Ter- rain parameters and different vegetation indiceswere derived for the covariates.We compared a generalized ad- ditive model (GAM) to randomforest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR). For the predictor selection, we used the recursive feature elimination (RFE). A land potential assessment for soil nutrients was conducted using trimmed k-mean cluster analysis. Results suggested that vegetation indices have powerful abilities to predict soil nutrients. Using selected predic- tors via RFE improved prediction results. RF showed the best performance. Cluster analysis identified four land potential classes: fertile, medium and low fertile with an additional class dominated by high phosphorus and low carbon and nitrogen contents due to human impact.

abstract = {Proximal sensing provides an alternative method to physical and chemical laboratory soil analyses. The aim of this study is to predict soil organic carbon (SOC), clay, sand, and silt content using reduced spectral features as covariables selected by two spectral preprocessing. A total of 299 soil samples were collected in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Two preprocessing techniques, detrend transformation and continuum removal (CR), were applied to isolate particular absorption features in the reflectance spectrum. Two techniques were used to select the spectral features in the spectrum: hand and mathematical selection. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Support vector machines (SVM) were applied to predict the soil properties. The reduction of predictor covariables by hand selection technique contributed in developing a high-level prediction model for SOC. PLSR and SVM presented no statistical difference between the RMSE results, except for clay content, where SVM presented superior performance. The preprocessing techniques were statistically identical based on RMSE results. Overall, the prediction of SOC, clay, sand and silt presented suitable results using reduced spectral features as covariables in modeling process.},

abstract = {Logistic regression is a particular instance of a broader kind of model, called a gener-alized linear model (GLM). You are familiar, of course, from your regression class with the idea of transforming the response variable, what we've been calling Y , and then predicting the transformed variable from X . This was not what we did in logis-tic regression. Rather, we transformed the conditional expected value, and made that a linear function of X . This seems odd, because it is odd, but it turns out to be useful. Let's be specific. Our usual focus in regression modeling has been the condi-tional expectation function, r (x) = E [Y |X = x]. In plain linear regression, we try to approximate r (x) by $\beta$ 0 + x {\textperiodcentered} $\beta$. In logistic regression, r (x) = E [Y |X = x] = Pr (Y = 1|X = x), and it is a transformation of r (x) which is linear. The usual nota-tion says $\eta$(x) = $\beta$ 0 + xc ˙ $\beta$ (13.1) $\eta$(x) = log r (x) 1 − r (x) (13.2) = g (r (x)) (13.3) defining the logistic link function by g (m) = log m/(1 − m). The function $\eta$(x) is called the linear predictor. Now, the naive strategy for estimating this model would be to all the transforma-tion g to the response. But Y is always zero or one, so g (Y) = ±∞, and regression will not be helpful here. The standard strategy is instead to use (what else?) Taylor expansion. Specifically, we try expanding g (Y) around r (x), and stop at first order: g (Y) ≈ g (r (x)) + (Y − r (x)) g {\"{i}}¿¿ (r (x)) (13.4)},

abstract = {The problem of variable selection within the class of generalized additive models, when there are many covariates to choose from but the number of predictors is still somewhat smaller than the number of observations, is considered. Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The software ArcGIS 10.2 was used to perform the semivariogram analysis and the fitting of the models, and spatial interpolation was performed using a first-order trend ordinary kriging process with spherical, exponential, and Gaussian spatial models. Based on the results, only the exponential and Gaussian models were fitted to the variables, except for the Mg2+ and V value variables, which presented no spatial dependence, thus showing a pure nugget effect (PNE). Distribution maps were generated for the variables (except for those exhibiting PNE), which showed correlation between the variables pH and Al3+, organic carbon and cations, phosphorus and total clay, and silt and sand. Overall, geostatistics could be applied to spatialize the chemical and physical attributes of the soil in the agroforestry system, except in the case of Mg2+ and the V value.},

It was possible to observe modifications in the distribution of humic substances in the study area. The results from this study are similar to those of other studies conducted in naive areas in the Atlantic Forest, demonstrating the benefits of using the agroforestry system.},

abstract = {Several techniques have been used to model the area covered by biomes or species. However, most models allow little freedom of choice of response variables and are conditioned to the use of climate predictors. This major restriction of the models has generated distributions of low accuracy or inconsistent with the actual cover. Our objective was to characterize the environmental space of the most representative biomes of Brazil and predict their cover, using climate and soil-related predictors. As sample units, we used 500 cells of 100 km2 for ten biomes, derived from the official vegetation map of Brazil (IBGE 2004). With a total of 38 (climatic and soil-related) predictors, an a priori model was run with the random forest classifier. Each biome was calibrated with 75{\%} of the samples. The final model was based on four climate and six soil-related predictors, the most important variables for the a priori model, without collinearity. The model reached a kappa value of 0.82, generating a highly consistent prediction with the actual cover of the country. We showed here that the richness of biomes should not be underestimated, and that in spite of the complex relationship, highly accurate modeling based on climatic and soil-related predictors is possible. These predictors are complementary, for covering different parts of the multidimensional niche. Thus, a single biome can cover a wide range of climatic space, versus a narrow range of soil types, so that its prediction is best adjusted by soil-related variables, or vice versa.},

abstract = {In environmental soil-landscape modeling (ESLM), the selection of predictive variables is commonly contingent on the researchers' domain expertise on soil-environment processes. This variable selection strategy may suffer bias or even fail in regions where the process knowledge is insufficient. To overcome this problem, this study demonstrates a holistic ESLM framework which consists of five components: model conceptualization, data compilation, process identification, parsimonious model calibration, and model validation. Based on the STEP-AWBH conceptual model, a comprehensive pool of 210 potential environmental variables that exhaustively cover pedogenic and environmental factors was constructed. This was followed by strategic variable selection and development of parsimonious prediction models using machine learning techniques. The all-relevant variable selection successfully identified the major and minor factors relevant to the SOC variation, showing that the major factors important for explaining SOC variation in Florida were vegetation and soil water gradient. Topography and climate showed moderate effects on SOC variation. Parsimonious SOC models developed using four minimal-optimal variable selection techniques and simulated annealing yielded optimal predictive performance with minimal model complexity. The holistic ESLM framework not only provides a new view of selecting and utilizing variables for predicting soil properties but can also assist in identifying the underlying processes of soil-environment systems of interest. Due to the flexibility of the framework to incorporate various types of variable selection and modeling techniques, the holistic environmental modeling strategy can be generalized to other environmental modeling domains for both prediction and process identification. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Surf Lifesaving (SLS) in Australia is an icon of local beach culture with more than 300 clubhouses distributed along the coastline. Their distribution at the interface of the terrestrial and marine environments means that assets and operations associated with SLS are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate variability and climate change from both the land and the sea. For Australia, this is particularly pertinent given that the east coast is projected to experience SLR that is higher than global average. This study describes how a probabilistic modelling approach (Bayesian belief networks (BBNs)) and participatory modelling techniques were used to help elicit information on the key adaptive capacity determinants influencing the ability of Australian SLS to implement climate change adaptation options. 10 BBNs were developed across four stakeholder workshops at four locations within Australia. Results of this participatory modelling show that most determinants of adaptive capacity broadly related to funding, knowledge, equipment, communication and community support. For each workshop, the BBNs indicated broad consensus in the beliefs of the stakeholders for these broad and perhaps well-known determinants of effective adaptation. Conversely, there was less agreement between the stakeholders regarding the more specific determinants as evidenced by the results of the sensitivity analyses and in the levels of debate between the stakeholders. This highlights that as the determinants of adaptive capacity become more nuanced, there is more likely to be an imperfect, and less likely to be a shared, understanding of the system by the stakeholders. Overall, the approach used in this study has shown to be effective in exploring adaptive capacity at the community level and to improve community understanding and awareness of coastal hazards and climate change risks.},

Current attempts to model ecosystem service delivery on a broad, regional scale often depend on indicator-based approaches that are generally not able to fully capture the complexity of ecosystem processes. Moreover, they do not allow quantification of uncertainty on their predictions. In this paper, we discuss a QGIS plug-in which promotes the use of Bayesian belief networks for regional modelling and mapping of ecosystem service delivery and associated uncertainties. Different types of specific Bayesian belief network output maps, delivered by the plug-in, are discussed and their decision support capacities are evaluated. This plug-in, used in combination with firmly developed Bayesian belief networks, has the potential to add value to current spatial ecosystem service accounting methods. The plug-in can also be used in other research domains dealing with spatial data and uncertainty.},

abstract = {A Bayesian belief network (BBN) was developed to assess preferred combinations of trees in live fences and on pastures in silvopastoral systems. The BBN was created with information from Rivas, Nicaragua, using local farmer knowledge on tree species, trees' costs and benefits, farmers' expressed needs and aspirations, and scientific knowledge regarding tree functional traits and their contribution to ecosystem services and benefits. The model identifies combinations of trees, which provide multiple ecosystem services from pastures, improving their productivity and contribution to farmer livelihoods. We demonstrate how the identification of portfolios of multifunctional trees can satisfy a profile of desired ecosystem services prioritized by the farmer. Diagnostics using Bayesian inference starts with an identification of farmer needs and 'works backwards' to identify a silvopastoral system structure. We conclude that Bayesian belief networks are a promising modeling technique for multi-criteria decisions in farm adaptation processes, where interventions must be adapted to specific contexts and farmer preferences.},

abstract = {This paper describes the basis functioning and implementation of a computer-aided Bayesian Network (BN) method that is able to incorporate experts' knowledge for the benefit of remote sensing applications and other raster data analyses: Bayesian Network for Raster Data (BayNeRD). Using a case study of soybean mapping in Mato Grosso State, Brazil, BayNeRD was tested to evaluate its capability to support the understanding of a complex phenomenon through plausible reasoning based on data observation. Observations made upon Crop Enhanced Index (CEI) values for the current and previous crop years, soil type, terrain slope, and distance to the nearest road and water body were used to calculate the probability of soybean presence for the entire Mato Grosso State, showing strong adherence to the official data. CEI values were the most influencial variables in the calculated probability of soybean presence, stating the potential of remote sensing as a source of data. Moreover, the overall accuracy of over 91{\%} confirmed the high accuracy of the thematic map derived from the calculated probability values. BayNeRD allows the expert to model the relationship among several observed variables, outputs variable importance information, handles incomplete and disparate forms of data, and offers a basis for plausible reasoning from observations. The BayNeRD algorithm has been implemented in R software and can be found on the internet.},

abstract = {The present paper evaluates five methods for building Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) from partial expert information: functional interpolation, the Elicitation BBN, the Cain calculator, Fenton et al. and R{\o}ed et al. methods. The evaluation considers application to a specific field of risk analysis, Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). The five methods are particularly suited for HRA models calculating the human error probability as a function of influencing factor assessments. The performance of the methods is evaluated on two simple examples, designed to test aspects relevant for HRA (but not exclusively): the representation of strong factor influences and interactions, the representation of uncertainty on the BBN relationships, and the method requirements as the BBN size increases. The evaluation underscores modelling limitations related to the treatment of multi-factor interdependencies and of different degrees of uncertainty in the factor relationships. The functional interpolation method is the least susceptible to these limitations; however, its elicitation requirements grow exponentially with the model size. Besides expert judgment, HRA applications of BBNs include the use of empirical data, combination of data and judgment, information from existing HRA methods: the building of the CPTs in these applications is outside the scope of the evaluation.},

The study used a statewide comprehensive soil survey comprising a small-scale soil map, a climate map, and a soil pedon database. Soil organic C stocks under native vegetation were calculated with two different approaches: the Tier 1 method of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a refi ned method based on actual fi eld measurements derived from soil profi le data. Highest SOC stocks occurred in Neossolos Quartzar{\^{e}}nico hidrom{\'{o}}rfi co (Aquents), Organossolos Tiom{\'{o}}rfi cos (Hemists), Latossolos Brunos (Udox), and Vertissolos Eb{\^{a}}nicos (Uderts) soil classes. Before human use of soils, most C was stored in the Latossolos Vermelhos (Udox) and Neossolos Regol{\'{i}}ticos (Orthents), which occupy a large area of Rio Grande do Sul. Generally, IPCC default reference SOC stocks compared well with SOC stocks calculated from soil pedons. The total SOC stock of Rio Grande do Sul was estimated at 1510.3 Tg C (5.8 kg C m−2) by the IPPC method and 1597.5 ± 363.9 Tg C (7.4 ± 1.9 kg C m−2) calculated from soil pedons. The SOC digital map and SOC database developed in this study provide crucial background information for state-level contemporary assessment of C stocks and soil C sequestration programs and initiatives.

abstract = {Bulk density (Bd) can easily be predicted from other data using pedotransfer functions (PTF). The present study developed two PTFs (PTF1 and PTF2) for Bd prediction in Brazilian organic soils and horizons and compared their performance with nine previously published equations. Samples of 280 organic soil horizons used to develop PTFs and containing at least 80 g kg-1 total carbon content (TOC) were obtained from different regions of Brazil. The multiple linear stepwise regression technique was applied to validate all the equations using an independent data set. Data were transformed using Box-Cox to meet the assumptions of the regression models. For validation of PTF1 and PTF2, the coefficient of determination (R2 ) was 0.47 and 0.37, mean error -0.04 and 0.10, and root mean square error 0.22 and 0.26, respectively. The best performance was obtained for the PTF1, PTF2, Hollis, and Honeysett equations. The PTF1 equation is recommended when clay content data are available, but considering that they are scarce for organic soils, the PTF2, Hollis, and Honeysett equations are the most suitable because they use TOC as a predictor variable. Considering the particular characteristics of organic soils and the environmental context in which they are formed, the equations developed showed good accuracy in predicting Bd compared with already existing equations},

abstract = {ABSTRACT (Soils associated with rock outcrops in the Brazilian mountain ranges Mantiqueira and Espinha{\c{c}}o). Espinha{\c{c}}o and Mantiqueira are two mountain ranges of great importance in Brazil. In the uppermost parts of these areas, unique ecosystems occur, generally associated with rock outcrops, they are collectively called High Altitude Rocky Complexes. These environments show distinct soil and biota characteristics in relation to the surrounding biome. The soils are generally shallow, coarse textured, with high Al3+ and varying amounts of organic matter. Entisols, Inceptsols and Histosols are dominant, directly associated with the rock outcrops, and forming a complex mosaic of soils. Some of these soils are endemic, based on peculiar conditions of parent materials, topography and vegetation, and this pedodiversity is important for detecting unique and endangered soils. In these soils, organic matter is highly humified, with a great amount of soluble forms and conspicuous presence of charcoal. Spodic horizons and dark water rivers are typically associated with quartzite and quartzite outcrops, formed by illuviation of organic compounds, being less common in granitic rocks. The very low nutrient content of these soils and other environmental limitations required the development of specific physiological and morphological plant adaptations. Most high altitude environments are unstable under current climatic conditions, and anthropic interventions may be accelerating this process. Detailed soil surveys are necessary for a better understanding of the role of these soils in ecological processes and for the development of adequate conservation policies RESUMO (Solos associados aos afloramentos rochosos das Serras do Espinha{\c{c}}o e da Mantiqueira).

abstract = {Many conservation and restoration efforts in developed countries are increasingly based on the premise of recognising and stimulating more ‘multi- functionality' in agricultural landscapes. Public pol- icy making is often a pragmatic process that involves efforts to negotiate trade-offs between the potentially conflicting demands of various stakeholders. Conser- vationists' efforts to influence policy making, can therefore benefit from any tool that will help them to identify other socio-economic functions or values that coincide with good ecological conservation options. Various types of socio-economic objectives have in recent years been mapped across landscapes and so there are now important opportunities to explore the spatial heterogeneity of these diverse functions across the wider landscape in search of potential spatial synergies, i.e. ‘multiple win locations' or multifunc- tional ‘hotspots'. This paper explores the potential occurrence of such synergies within the agricultural landscape of northeast Scotland and evaluates an existing woodland planting policy using and combining three different policy objectives. Our results show that there are indeed broad areas of the studied landscape where multiple objec- tives (biodiversity, visual amenity and on-site recrea- tion potential) could be achieved simultaneously (hotspots), and that the case study which we evaluate (the FarmWoodland Premium Scheme) could be much better spatially targeted with regards to each individual objective as well as with regards to these hotspots of multifunctionality.},

Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent.

@article{Cleasby2011,
abstract = {One of the fundamental assumptions underlying linear regression models is that the errors have a constant variance (i.e., homoscedastic). When this assumption is violated, standard errors from a regression can be biased and inconsistent, meaning that the associated p values and 95{\%} confidence intervals cannot be trusted. The assumption of homoscedasticity is made for statistical reasons rather than biological reasons; in most real datasets, some form of heteroscedasticity is likely to exist. However, a survey of the behavioural ecology literature showed that only about 5{\%} of articles explicitly mentioned heteroscedasticity, leaving 95{\%} of articles in which heteroscedasticity was apparently absent. These results strongly indicate that the prevalence of heteroscedasticity is widely under-reported within behavioural ecology. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of heteroscedasticity amongst behavioural ecologists. Using topical examples from fields in behavioural ecology such as sexual dimorphism and animal personality, we highlight the biological importance of considering heteroscedasticity. We also emphasize that researchers should pay closer attention to the variance in their data and consider what factors could cause heteroscedasticity. In addition, we introduce some simple methods of dealing with heteroscedasticity. The two methods we focus on are: (1) incorporating variance functions within a generalised least squares (GLS) framework to model the functional form of heteroscedasticity and; (2) heteroscedasticity-consistent standard error (HCSE) estimators, which can be used when the functional form of heteroscedasticity is unknown. Using case studies, we show how both methods can influence the output from linear regression models. Finally, we hope that more researchers will consider heteroscedasticity as an important source of additional information about the particular biological process being studied, rather than an impediment to statistical analysis.},

abstract = {A soil survey is the main source of soil spatial information and is very useful in supporting land use decisions, especially for agronomic purposes. However, the continuity of soil surveying in Brazil has been compromised due the minimal amount of government investment in the sector. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of three data mining methods-decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN)-with R software to predict soil map units from the Guapi-Macacu watershed in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), remote sensing data (Landsat 5), and a geology map were used as predictors. Evaluation of the models' performance was based on statistical indices obtained from a confusion matrix by using validation samples. Furthermore, a comparison was performed to analyze the agreement between the maps created from the models and from a conventional soil map (legacy data); sampling locations were not used as input data in the training process. The results indicated better performance from the RF model compared with the DT and ANN models. The accuracy was calculated through validation samples indicating values in the Kappa index corresponding to 0.76 (RF), 0.72 (ANN) and 0.66 (DT). A comparison between the maps obtained from the models and the conventional soil map exhibited better agreement with the RF model (68.7{\%}), followed by the ANN (62.8{\%}), and DT (62.3{\%}) models. The classification accuracy, obtained through comparisons with sampling locations, exhibited correct classification of 57.6{\%} in the RF model, 56.8{\%} in the DT, and 56.1{\%} in the ANN model; the conventional soil map had 69.7{\%} correct classification. In general, most of the confusion between soil map units was observed in Haplic Gleysols, Haplic Acrisols (Clayic) and Fluvisols. In terms of covariates importance, in general, the terrain attributes derived from the DEM had more influence as predictor covariates than the indices obtained from the Landsat data. The application of data mining can improve the methods applied to soil map units, thereby contributing to increasing information related to soil-landscape relationships and enhancing the products of soil surveys.},

abstract = {The high-level language of R is recognized as one of the most powerful and flexible statistical software environments, and is rapidly becoming the standard setting for quantitative analysis, statistics and graphics. R provides free access to unrivalled coverage and cutting-edge applications, enabling the user to apply numerous statistical methods ranging from simple regression to time series or multivariate analysis. Building on the success of the authors bestselling Statistics: An Introduction using R, The R Book is packed with worked examples, providing an all inclusive guide to R, ideal for novice and more accomplished users alike. The book assumes no background in statistics or computing and introduces the advantages of the R environment, detailing its applications in a wide range of disciplines. Provides the first comprehensive reference manual for the R language, including practical guidance and full coverage of the graphics facilities. Introduces all the statistical models covered by R, beginning with simple classical tests such as chi-square and t-test. Proceeds to examine more advance methods, from regression and analysis of variance, through to generalized linear models, generalized mixed models, time series, spatial statistics, multivariate statistics and much more. The R Book is aimed at undergraduates, postgraduates and professionals in science, engineering and medicine. It is also ideal for students and professionals in statistics, economics, geography and the social sciences.},

Once the model has been introduced it is used to generate synthetic data, using R code, and these generated data are then used to estimate its parameters. This sequence confirms understanding of both the model and the R routine for fitting it to the data. Finally, the model is applied to an analysis of a historical data set. By using R, the whole procedure can be reproduced by the reader. All the data sets used in the book are available on the website The book is written for undergraduate students of mathematics, economics, business and finance, geography, engineering and related disciplines, and postgraduate students who may need to analyze time series as part of their taught program or their research.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Abstract: This paper deals with the challenge in modeling environmental fragility, which implies not only the understanding of the intrinsic and dynamic relationship between the physical, biotic and socio-economic components of environmental systems, but also in trying to translate this knowledge in mathematical models. In order to shed some light on this difficulty, the results generated by two empirical models of environmental fragility were presented and compared, models that are widely used (CREPANI et al. 2001 and ROSS, 1994). These two models were applied in two thesis-areas with very diverging results. Within this context of uncertainties, this paper tested the feasibility and reliability of a new tool that can be applied in the elaboration of environmental fragility models, the artificial neural networks. For that, were used the knowledge and experience of specialists in this area. The results proved that it is possible to emulate, with reasonable reliability, the evaluation pattern of specialists in the definition of environmental systems fragility, eliminating in this way, the arbitrariness and subjectivity in the elaboration process of environmental fragility models. This work does not present a new model, but rather a methodology for the construction of models using artificial neural networks, taking the first step in the search of new techniques, sometimes feared by the geographers, however necessary for the evolution of the geographic science.

After defining environmental vulnerability criteria and factors, IDRISI 32's decision making routines were applied. The factors were standardized to a common numeric range (0 to 255) and then combined by means of a weighted average (weighted linear combination – WLC) to obtain the relative environmental vulnerability map. This map shows a range of continuous values varying from 0 (low vulnerability) to 255 (high vulnerability). The methodology, as well as the computational analysis tool are very flexible helping to reach a technical consensus or a decision making, which are very important aspects to integrated coastal zone management programs.},

Mechanized agriculture with soybean and corn cultivation currently occupies 54.52{\%} of the area, in land previously occupied by pastures and natural vegetation. The predominant class is the medium fragility one, with a prevalence of 65.62{\%} of the total area.},

abstract = {Mountain tourism in developing countries is becoming a growing environmental concern due to extreme seasonality, lack of suitable infrastructures and planning, and interference with fragile ecosystems and protected areas. This paper presents a study devoted to assess the adverse environmental impacts of tourism, and in particular of trekking-related activities, in Ladakh, Indian Himalaya. The proposed approach is based on the use of Geographical Information System (GIS) modeling and remote sensing imageries to cope with the lack of data that affect the region. First, stressors associated with trekking, and environmental receptors potentially affected were identified. Subsequently, a baseline study on stressors (trail use, waste dumping, camping, pack animal grazing and off-road driving) and receptors (soil, water, wildlife, vegetation) was conducted through field work, data collection, and data processing supported by GIS. Finally, impacts were modeled by considering the intensity of the stressors, and the vulnerability and the value of the receptors. The results were spatially aggregated into watershed units, and combined to generate composite impact maps. The study concluded that the most affected watersheds are located in the central and southeastern part of Ladakh, along some of the most visited trails and within the Hemis and the Tsokar Tsomoriri National parks. The main objective of the study was to understand patterns of tourism-induced environmental degradation, so as to support mitigation interventions, as well as the development of suitable tourism policies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

O Estado do Rio Grande do Norte possui duas zonas ambientais distintas: a terrestre e a mar{\'{i}}tima, que se caracterizam como zonas homog{\^{e}}neas em rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o aos recursos naturais.

Este trabalho tem por objetivo geral, identificar, mapear e interpretar a evolu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do uso e ocupa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do solo e a vulnerabilidade ambiental do Munic{\'{i}}pio de Guamar{\'{e}} (RN), tendo como base o uso de uma metodologia para a interpreta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o multitemporal de imagens de sensores remotos e reconhecimento de campo, integrados em ambiente Sistema de Informa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o Geogr{\'{a}}fica (SIG). Foi realizado um ensaio preliminar sobre a vulnerabilidade do entorno a acidentes nas instala{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es e dutos do P{\'{o}}lo Petrol{\'{i}}fero de Guamar{\'{e}}. O per{\'{i}}odo de 1996 a 2001 verificou uma altera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o mais significativa no uso e ocupa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do solo provocado pelo aparecimento de classes antes n{\~{a}}o existentes (carcinicultura, a{\c{c}}ude e assentamento) e pela redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dr{\'{a}}stica das {\'{a}}reas de salinas. Nos anos analisados, o surgimento da atividade da cria{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de camar{\~{a}}o no munic{\'{i}}pio n{\~{a}}o afetou significativamente o sistema manguezal, j{\'{a}} que houve o aproveitamento das antigas salinas.

abstract = {To predict soil maps, data-mining techniques can be utilised. The aim of these techniques is to extract hidden predictive knowledge from large databases. In terms of soil science they are able to learn the relationship between mapped soil classes as well as soil-forming factors, which can be used to predict soil classes in comparable landscape units. Thus, it is possible to automatically build reproducible digital soil maps, helping to speed up field mapping and to reduce costs. The main objective of this chapter is to compare the ability of different data-mining techniques and algorithms from statistics and information theory, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), linear regression, learning vector quantisation and classification trees. The techniques are discussed in terms of prediction accuracy and usability for GIS-based usage. Altogether 10 data-mining algorithms were tested to predict soil classes on the basis of 65-terrain attributes. Prediction accuracy is tested inside and outside the learning area to compare their generalisation ability. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Disaggregation of conventional soil surveys has been identified as a potential source for much of the next generation of model-ready digital soil spatial data. This process aims to apportion vector soil surveys into raster (gridded) representations of the component soils that are often aggregated together in map unit designs. Most soil surveys are published with some description of the soil-landscape relationships that distinguish component soils within map units. We used these descriptions found in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of Webster and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, USA, to build a set of representative training areas for all soil components by using 1-arc second digital elevation data and derived geomorphic indices. These training areas were then used in classification tree ensembles with a more extensive environmental database to transform the original SSURGO map into a gridded soil series map. We created underlying prediction frequency surfaces from the models that can be used for creating continuous representations of soil class and property distributions. Disaggregation models matched training sets in 71{\%}-74{\%} of pixels and matched components in original SSURGO map units in 56{\%}-65{\%} of the study area. We evaluated both the original SSURGO data and our models using 87 independent pedons not used in model building. Validation pedons matched components in SSURGO map units at 39{\%} of sites, but in map units that only included one named component (as opposed to multiple soils that could be matched to validation pedons) only 27{\%} of the sites matched. Disaggregation predictions matched validation pedon classes 22-24{\%} of the time using nearest neighbor spatial matches, and these rates increased to 39-44{\%} for correct predictions within a 60-meter radius of the pedon. To characterize uncertainty, we compared relative ensemble prediction frequency (probability) of final hardened model classes at validation sites. Sites with correct predictions had generally higher prediction frequencies; which lead us to use them to create an uncertainty model. Uncertainty was calculated by determining the rate of correct predictions at validation sites within different intervals of prediction frequencies using nearest neighbor validation results. We were able to discern four uncertainty classes with values of 7{\%}, 18{\%}, 20{\%} and 43{\%}, which we called "ground truth probabilities". We present the methods to create these models as a specific example of how disaggregation techniques may be used to aid in updating national soil survey inventories. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We modelled the distribution of soil properties across the agricultural zone on the Australian continent using data mining and knowledge discovery from databases (DM{\&}KDD) tools. Piecewise linear tree models were built choosing from 19 climate variables, digital elevation model (DEM) and derived terrain attributes, four Landsat multi-spectral scanner (MSS) bands, land use and lithology maps as predictors of topsoil and subsoil pH, organic C, {\%} clay, and total N and P. The actual geographic location of the sampled soil data points was not used as a predictor. Classification trees were used to estimate topsoil and subsoil horizon thickness and texture class using similar predictors. That maps could be made using the decision tree models attests to the occurrence of knowledge discovery from the soil point databases used as training data. The decision tree models were evaluated and interpreted in a spatial context by: (1) tabulation of variables selected by the tree models; (2) mapping of the extent over which individual predictors were used and their thresholds; and (3) mapping of the extent over which combinations of predictors were used. The evaluation and interpretation process indicates that the models are consistent with general principles of soil genesis and that detailed investigation of the models' structure in a spatial context may have other uses in biogeographical studies and geo-ecological process modelling. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The principle of using induction rules based on spatial environmental data to model a soil map has previously been demonstrated. Whilst the general pattern of classes of large spatial extent and those with close association with geology were delineated, small classes and the detailed spatial pattern of the map were less well rendered. Here we examine several strategies to improve the quality of the soil map models generated by rule induction. Terrain attributes that are better-suited to landscape description at a resolution of 250 m are introduced as predictors of soil type. A map sampling strategy is developed. Classification error is reduced by using boosting rather than cross-validation to improve the model. Further, the benefit of incorporating the local spatial context for each environmental variable into the rule induction is examined. The best model was achieved by sampling in proportion to the spatial extent of the mapped classes, boosting the decision trees, and using spatial contextual information extracted from the environmental variables.},

abstract = {Area-pedodiversity, area–vegetation diversity, area-bioclimatic belts, diversity and pedodiversity-vegetation diversity-bioclimatic diversity relationships were analyzed for the most arid region of Western Europe (SE Spain). The study is novel in that it analyzed these relationships using as operational geographic units (OGUs) the set of polygons belonging to the same character state (i.e., typology) that defines a zone in a given thematic map. We considered three thematic maps: 1) the map of soil associations (SMU) with 303 different soil associations (i.e., 303 areas or zones); 2) the map of potential vegetation (PNV) with 40 vegetation series or zones and 3) the map of bioclimatic belts (BB) with 7 bioclimatic zones. Using GIS tools, we analyzed the contents (richness) of soil mapping units (polygons) with regard to vegetation series and bioclimatic belts as well as the contents of vegetation series and bioclimatic belts with regard to SMU. The results indicate that the relationships between the area and the richness of zones follow a power law, the “fingerprint of fractal geometry”, irrespective of the way the area has been defined and their relative magnitude (the areas defined by SMU are the smallest, while the areas defined by bioclimatic belts are the largest). The results also indicate a significant correlation between the $\alpha$ diversities of the zones and between their $\beta$ diversities. We conclude that the methods used to measure such correlations, based on $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversities are useful to investigate and quantify the relationships between the pedosphere, vegetation and climate.},

abstract = {Most highly accurate predictive modelling techniques produce opaque models. When comprehensible models are required, rule extraction is sometimes used to generate a transparent model, based on the opaque. Naturally, the extracted model should be as similar as possible to the opaque. This criterion, called fidelity, is therefore a key part of the optimisation function in most rule extracting algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, all existing rule extraction algorithms targeting fidelity use 0/1 fidelity, i.e., maximise the number of identical classifications. In this paper, we suggests and evaluate a rule extraction algorithm using a more informed fidelity criterion. More specifically, the novel algorithms, which is based on genetic programming, minimises the difference in probability estimates between the extracted and the opaque models, by using the generalised Brier score as fitness function. Experimental results from 26 UCI data sets show that the suggested algorithm obtained considerably higher accuracy and significantly better AUC than both the exact same rule extraction algorithm maximizing 0/1 fidelity, and the standard tree inducer J48. Somewhat surprisingly, rule extraction using the more informed fidelity metric normally resulted in less complex models, making sure that the improved predictive performance was not achieved on the expense of comprehensibility.},

In this study, we investigate the possibility of using airborne hyperspectral imagery for the classification of ecotopes.

Our results show that Adaboost and Random Forest attain almost the same overall accuracy (close to 70{\%}) with less than 1{\%} difference, and both outperform a neural network classifier (63.7{\%}). Random Forest, however, is faster in training and more stable. Both ensemble classifiers are considered effective in dealing with hyperspectral data. Furthermore, two feature selection methods, the out-of-bag strategy and a wrapper approach feature subset selection using the best-first search method are applied.

Our band subset analyses also include the 22 optimal bands between 0.4 and 2.5 $\mu$m suggested in Thenkabail et al. [Thenkabail, P.S., Enclona, E.A., Ashton, M.S., and Van Der Meer, B. (2004).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection. RESULTS: We investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy. CONCLUSION: Because of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data.},

abstract = {In this paper we study random forests through their connection with a new framework of adaptive nearest neighbor methods. We first introduce a concept of potential nearest neighbors (k-PNN's) and show that random forests can be seen as adaptively weighted k-PNN methods. Various aspects of random forests are then studied from this perspective. We investigate the effect of terminal node sizes and splitting schemes on the performance of random forests. It has been commonly believed that random forests work best using largest trees possible. We derive a lower bound to the rate of the mean squared error of regression random forests with non-adaptive splitting schemes and show that, asymptotically, growing largest trees in such random forests is not optimal. However, it may take a very large sample size for this asymptotic result to kick in for high dimensional problems. We illustrate with simulations the effect of terminal node sizes on the prediction accuracy of random forests with other splitting schemes. In general, it is advantageous to tune the terminal node size for best performance of random forests. We further show that random forests with adaptive splitting schemes assign weights to k-PNN's in a desirable way: for the estimation at a given target point, these random forests assign voting weights to the k-PNN's of the target point according to the local importance of different input variables. We propose a new simple splitting scheme that achieves desirable adaptivity in a straightforward fashion. This simple scheme can be combined with existing algorithms. The resulting algorithm is computationally faster, and gives comparable results. Other possible aspects of random forests, such as using linear combinations in splitting, are also discussed. Simulations and real datasets are used to illustrate the results.},

abstract = {Highland environments favor accumulation and preservation of soil organic matter (SOM) due to low temperatures, leading to the formation of Histosols. The Itatiaia National Park (INP), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, offers conditions for preservation of SOM deposited over time, which has led to the formation of these soils. The objective of this study was to characterize Histosols in this environment, with the premise that it may provide evidence of changes in vegetation. Organossolos (Histosols) were sampled, characterized, described, and analyzed for their properties, stable isotopes of 12 C and 13 C, 14 N and 15 N, and dating of organic matter through 14 C. The soils were classified in the Brazilian Soil Classification System as Organossolo H{\'{a}}plico H{\^{e}}mico t{\'{i}}pico - RJ-01 (Haplohemists) and Organossolo F{\'{o}}lico S{\'{a}}prico cambiss{\'{o}}lico - RJ-02 (Udifolists). The morphological properties, degree of transformation, and chemical fractioning of SOM were consistent with hemic and sapric materials. The $\delta$13 C and $\delta$15 N isotopic analyses showed a difference in the contribution of plant materials. In RJ-01, there was previous influence of algae, due to poor drainage, and depletion of $\delta$13 C, suggesting a mix of C3 and C4 plants. RJ-02 showed influence of C3 type plants. The 14 C dating for RJ-01 was 3280±80},

The high dimensionality and grouped nature of this type of data can complicate standard analysis, summarization, and visualization. The "aqp" (algorithms for quantitative pedology) package was designed to support data-driven approaches to common soils-related tasks such as visualization, aggregation, and classification of soil profile collections. In addition, we sought to advance the study of numerical soil classification by building on previously published methods within an extensible and open source framework. Functions in the aqp package have been successfully applied to studies involving several thousand soil profiles.

abstract = {Soil provides ecosystem services, supports human health and habitation, stores carbon and regulates emissions of greenhouse gases. Unprecedented pressures on soil from degradation and urbanization are threatening agro-ecological balances and food security. It is important that we learn more about soil to sustainably manage and preserve it for future generations. To this end, we developed and analyzed a global soil visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectral library. It is currently the largest and most diverse database of its kind. We show that the information encoded in the spectra can describe soil composition and be associated to land cover and its global geographic distribution, which acts as a surrogate for global climate variability. We also show the usefulness of the global spectra for predicting soil attributes such as soil organic and inorganic carbon, clay, silt, sand and iron contents, cation exchange capacity, and pH. Using wavelets to treat the spectra, which were recorded in different laboratories using different spectrometers and methods, helped to improve the spectroscopic modelling. We found that modelling a diverse set of spectra with a machine learning algorithm can find the local relationships in the data to produce accurate predictions of soil properties. The spectroscopic models that we derived are parsimonious and robust, and using them we derived a harmonized global soil attribute dataset, which might serve to facilitate research on soil at the global scale. This spectroscopic approach should help to deal with the shortage of data on soil to better understand it and to meet the growing demand for information to assess and monitor soil at scales ranging from regional to global. New contributions to the library are encouraged so that this work and our collaboration might progress to develop a dynamic and easily updatable database with better global coverage. We hope that this work will reinvigorate our community's discussion towards larger, more coordinated collaborations. We also hope that use of the database will deepen our understanding of soil so that we might sustainably manage it and extend the research outcomes of the soil, earth and environmental sciences towards applications that we have not yet dreamed of.},

abstract = {Existing predictive soil mapping (PSM) methods often require soil sample data to be sufficient to represent soil–environment relationships throughout the study area. However, in many parts of the world with only a limited quantity of soil sample data to represent the study area, this is still an issue for PSM application. This paper presents a method, named ‘individual predictive soil mapping' (iPSM), which can make use of limited soil sample data for PSM. With the assumption that similar environmental conditions have similar soils, iPSM uses the soil–environment relationship at each individual soil sample location to predict soil properties at unvisited locations and estimate prediction uncertainty. Specifically, the environmental similarities of an unvisited location to a set of soil sample locations are used in a weighted average method to integrate the soil–environment relationships at sample locations for prediction and uncertainty estimation. As a case study, iPSM was applied to map soil organic matter (SOM) content ({\%}) in the topsoil layer using two sets of soil samples. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), iPSM produced a more accurate SOM map (root mean squared error (RMSE) 1.43, mean absolute error (MAE) 1.16) than MLR (RMSE 8.54, MAE 7.34) the ability of the sample set to represent the study area is limited and achieved a comparable accuracy (RMSE 1.10, MAE 0.69) with MLR (RMSE 1.01, MAE 0.73) when the sample set could represent the study area better. In addition, the prediction uncertainty estimated by iPSM was positively related to prediction residuals in both scenarios. This study demonstrates that iPSM is an effective alternative when existing soil samples are limited in their ability to represent the study area and the prediction uncertainty in iPSM can be used as an indicator of its prediction accuracy.},

Therefore a systematic approach for model calibration is proposed which is guided by the intended model use, and which is supported by adequate techniques, prior knowledge and expert judgement. The success of calibration will be primarily limited by the nature, amount and quality of the available data, in relation to the complexity of the model; additional limitations are the effectiveness of the applied techniques and the availability of time, man- and computer power, adequate expertise and financial resources. These limitations will often preclude a unique calibrated model. As a consequence, calibration studies should provide information on the non-uniqueness and/or uncertainty which will be left in the model (parameters) after calibration, and this uncertainty should be adequately accounted for in subsequent model applications. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the digital elevation model spatial resolution and of the efficiency of Random Forest models on the prediction of sand, clay, and organic carbon contents, using few soil samples. The study was carried out in a Cerrado area with lithological diversity, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, using morphometric attributes, TM Landsat 5 sensor data, and lithology as predictive covariates. The surface layer data (0.0–0.2 m) of 175 soil profiles (0,009 profiles km-2 ) and of 26 predictor covariates were used with 30 (set 1) and 90-m (set 2) spatial resolutions. The performed analysis by Random Forest models showed that channel base level, elevation, and lithology were the most important ones to explain the variability. The validation of the models showed similarity among sets for the prediction of sand, clay, and organic carbon contents, which explains the following values of spatial variability, respectively: 44, 40, and 33{\%}, for the spatial resolution of 30 m; and 45, 46, and 33{\%}, for the spatial resolution of 90 m. The spatial resolution of the predictive covariates has little effect on attribute predictions, and the Random Forest approach has potential use for estimating soil properties},

abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) are representations of topography with inherent errors that constitute uncertainty. DEM data are often used in analyses without quantifying the effects of these errors. This paper describes a Monte Carlo methodology for evaluation of the effects of uncertainty on elevation and derived topographic parameters. Four methods for representing DEM uncertainty that utilize meta- data and spatial characteristics of a DEM are presented. Seven statistics derived from simulation results were used to quantify the effect of DEM error. When uncertainty was quantified by the average relative absolute difference, ele- vation did not deviate. The range of deviation across the four methods for slope was 5 to 8 percent, 460 to 950 percent for derived catchment areas and 4 to 9 percent for the topographic index. This research demonstrates how application of this methodology can address DEM uncer- tainty, contributing to more responsible use of elevation and derived topographic parameters, and ultimately results obtained from their use.},

abstract = {The variation of soil properties down a profile is usually considered continuous. The aim of this study was to develop and test a methodology to model the continuous vertical and lateral distributions of SOC stocks in Scottish soils making explicit the modelling and spatial uncertainty of the results. A comparison with regression kriging and other depth function methods is provided to show that better performances can be achieved taking into account non-linear relationships between covariates and soil properties. The analysis was run for the whole of Scotland. The carbon stocks were calculated for each point, i.e. each horizon in each available profile. The stock value at each cell for each of the considered depth layers was defined using a hybrid GAM-geostatistical 3D model, combining: 1) the fitting of a GAM to estimate the trend of the variable, using a 3D smoother with related covariates; and 2) kriging or Gaussian simulations of GAM residuals as spatial component to account for local details. The use of GAM makes the approach flexible, because it is able to deal with both linear and non-linear relationships between soil properties and the considered covariates. The results confirmed that MODIS data are a useful source of information for DSM especially at national scale. When comparing the proposed approach with similar methods such as regression kriging, the results showed better agreement with the data in the validation set with a global R2 of 0.60. The median values obtained are comparable with the values reported from previous studies on stocks in Scotland using different methods. The uncertainty is large indicating a wide range of credible values for each pixel. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Knowledge of soil properties with complete area coverage is needed for policy-making, land resource management, and monitoring environmental impacts. Remote sensing offers possibilities to support Digital Soil Mapping, especially in data-poor regions. The aim of this work was to test the potential of time-series of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation and drought indices to provide relevant information to model topsoil properties in a Boreal-Atlantic region (Scotland) focussing on differentiation between soils with high and soils with low organic matter contents. For each of the three considered years, 345 MODIS data sets were included in the exploratory analysis; 15 data products for 23 dates (bi-weekly) per year. Terrain parameters derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were also included. A methodology was implemented to exploit fully the high number of covariates, to identify the band, index or product that best correlates with the soil property of interest. In particular the proposed approach i. relies on freely globally available data-sets; ii. uses statistical criteria to select the combination of covariates providing the highest predictive capability, among the data considered and available; iii. deals with both continuous (using Generalized Additive Models, GAMs) and multinomial categorical (using Random Trees) types of variables; iv. takes into account fully the spatial autocorrelation of the data; v. provides estimates of the spatial uncertainty for each pixel; and vi. is computationally efficient when compared with methods such as forward stepwise. The models fitted show a fairly good agreement with existing data sets, presenting a consistent spatial pattern. The use of MODIS data as covariates increased the predictive capabilities of GAMs using only terrain parameters. The misclassification error for organic matter classes was between 25 and 35{\%}. The assessment provided of the spatial uncertainty of the modelled values can be used in further modelling and in the assessment of consequences of climate-change and trade-off in land use changes. This approach can contribute to improving our understanding and modelling of soil processes and function over large, and relatively sparsely sampled, areas of the world. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, we evaluate the application of a Random Forest (RF) classifier as a tool for understanding and predicting the complex hierarchical relationships between soil parent material and topography using a digital elevation model (DEM) and conventional soil survey maps. Single-component soil polygons from conventional soil survey maps of the Langley-Vancouver Map Area, British Columbia (Canada), were used to generate randomized training points for 9 parent material classes. Each point was intersected with values from 27 topographic indices derived from a 100m DEM. RF's mtry parameter was optimized using multiple replicates of 5-fold cross validation and parent material predictions were made for the region. Predictive parent material maps were validated through comparisons with legacy soil survey maps and 307 field points. Results show that predictions made by a non-optimized RF resulted in a kappa index of 89.6{\%} when validated with legacy soil survey data from single-component polygons and a kappa index of 79.5{\%} when validated with field data. Variable reduction and mtry optimization resulted in minimal improvements in RF predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RF as a machine learning and data mining approach; however, the need for reliable training data was highlighted by less reliable results for polygon disaggregation in portions of the map where fewer training data points could be established. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This work presents the selection of a set of geostatistical coefficients suitable for a unified SRTM data refinement from 3' to 1' through kriging over the entire Brazilian territory. This selection aimed at data potential for geomorphometric derivations, given by the preservation of detailed geometric characteristics of the resulting digital elevation models (DEM), which are sensitive to refining procedures. The development contained a long-term experimentation stage, when data refinement through kriging was locally developed to support distinct regional projects, followed by a unified selection stage, where the acquired experience was applied to select a single and unified interpolation scheme. In this stage, the selected geostatistical models with promising performances were tested for unified refinement on 40 Brazilian areas with distinct geological settings. Tested areas encompass reliefs varying from mountainous to plain. The effects of data preparation were observed on the perception of patterns (texture and roughness), as well as of singularities (edges, peaks, thalwegs etc.). Results were evaluated mainly through the examination of shaded reliefs, transects and perspectives observed in different scales. Terrains with low slopes and small amplitudes had their DEM promptly affected by the refining methods, as opposed to mountainous terrains. The evaluation, unambiguously confirmed by all consulted interpreters, converged into a refining model with outstanding performance in all tested conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mapping the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes is important for informing soil use and management decisions. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can quantitatively predict the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes. Key components of DSM are the method and the set of environmental covariates used to predict soil classes. Machine learning is a general term for a broad set of statistical modeling techniques. Many different machine learning models have been applied in the literature and there are different approaches for selecting covariates for DSM. However, there is little guidance as to which, if any, machine learning model and covariate set might be optimal for predicting soil classes across different landscapes. Our objective was to compare multiple machine learning models and covariate sets for predicting soil taxonomic classes at three geographically distinct areas in the semi-arid western United States of America (southern New Mexico, southwestern Utah, and northeastern Wyoming). All three areas were the focus of digital soil mapping studies. Sampling sites at each study area were selected using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). We compared models that had been used in other DSM studies, including clustering algorithms, discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression, neural networks, tree based methods, and support vector machine classifiers. Tested machine learning models were divided into three groups based on model complexity: simple, moderate, and complex. We also compared environmental covariates derived from digital elevation models and Landsat imagery that were divided into three different sets: 1) covariates selected a priori by soil scientists familiar with each area and used as input into cLHS, 2) the covariates in set 1 plus 113 additional covariates, and 3) covariates selected using recursive feature elimination.Overall, complex models were consistently more accurate than simple or moderately complex models. Random forests (RF) using covariates selected via recursive feature elimination was consistently the most accurate, or was among the most accurate, classifiers between study areas and between covariate sets within each study area. We recommend that for soil taxonomic class prediction, complex models and covariates selected by recursive feature elimination be used.Overall classification accuracy in each study area was largely dependent upon the number of soil taxonomic classes and the frequency distribution of pedon observations between taxonomic classes. Individual subgroup class accuracy was generally dependent upon the number of soil pedon observations in each taxonomic class. The number of soil classes is related to the inherent variability of a given area. The imbalance of soil pedon observations between classes is likely related to cLHS. Imbalanced frequency distributions of soil pedon observations between classes must be addressed to improve model accuracy. Solutions include increasing the number of soil pedon observations in classes with few observations or decreasing the number of classes. Spatial predictions using the most accurate models generally agree with expected soil-landscape relationships. Spatial prediction uncertainty was lowest in areas of relatively low relief for each study area.},

On these datasets we obtained classification accuracy of 100{\%} in the best case and of around 99.8{\%} on average. This is very promising compared to the previously reported results.

abstract = {The spatial distribution of soil carbon (C) is controlled by ecological processes that evolve and interact over a range of spatial scales across the landscape. The relationships between hydrologic and biotic processes and soil C patterns and spatial behavior are still poorly understood. Our objectives were to (i) identify the appropriate spatial scale to observe soil total C (TC) in a subtropical landscape with pronounced hydrologic and biotic variation, and (ii) investigate the spatial behavior and relationships between TC and ecological landscape variables which aggregate various hydrologic and biotic processes. The study was conducted in Florida, USA, characterized by extreme hydrologic (poorly to excessively drained soils), and vegetation/land use gradients ranging from natural uplands and wetlands to intensively managed forest, agricultural, and urban systems. We used semivariogram and landscape indices to compare the spatial dependence structures of TC and 19 ecological landscape variables, identifying similarities and establishing pattern-process relationships. Soil, hydrologic, and biotic ecological variables mirrored the spatial behavior of TC at fine (few kilometers), and coarse (hundreds of kilometers) spatial scales. Specifically, soil available water capacity resembled the spatial dependence structure of TC at escalating scales, supporting a multi-scale soil hydrology-soil C process-pattern relationship in Florida. Our findings suggest two appropriate scales to observe TC, one at a short range (autocorrelation range of 5.6 km), representing local soil-landscape variation, and another at a longer range (119 km), accounting for regional variation. Moreover, our results provide further guidance to measure ecological variables influencing C dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Topography is an important land-surface characteristic that affects most aspects of the water balance in a catchment, including the generation of surface and sub-surface runoff; the flow paths followed by water as it moves down and through hillslopes and the rate of water movement. All of the spatially explicit fully distributed hydraulic and hydrological models use topography (represented by the DEM of the area modelled) to derive bathymetry. DEM is also used to derive some other key information critical in fully distributed hydraulic and hydrological models.With high-resolution DEMs such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) becoming more readily available and also with the advancements in computing facilities which can handle these large data sets, there is a need to quantify the impact of using different resolution DEMs (e.g. 1 m against 10 m or 25 m) on hydrologically important variables and the loss of accuracy and reliability of the results as we move from high resolution to coarser resolution.The results from statistical analysis carried out to compare field survey elevations with the LiDAR DEM-derived elevations, show that there are small differences between the two data sets but LiDAR DEM is a reasonably good representation of the actual ground surface compared to other commonly used DEMs derived from contour maps.The results from the analysis clearly show that the accuracy and resolution of the input DEM have serious implications on the values of the hydrologically important spatial indices derived from the DEM. The result also indicates that the loss of details by re-sampling the higher resolution DEM to coarser resolution are much less compared to the details captured in the commonly available coarse resolution DEM derived from contour maps. Topographic indices based on contour derived DEMs should be used with caution and where available, the higher resolution DEM should be used instead of the coarse resolution one. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A variety of landscape properties have been modelled successfully using topographic indices such as the topographic wetness index (TWI), defined as ln(a/tan $\beta$), where a is the specific upslope area and $\beta$ is the surface slope. Previous studies have shown the influence of scale on TWI values when converting standard-resolution DEMs to coarser resolutions. In this study a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with a 5 m grid size derived from LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data was used to investigate the scale-dependency of TWI values when converting from high-resolution elevation data to standard-resolution DEMs. First, a set of DEMs was generated from an initial DEM by thinning to resolutions of 10, 25, and 50 m grid sizes to study the effects of lower grid size and decreased information content. Next, to investigate the impact of different information content on DEMs with the same grid size, the three lower resolution DEMs were all interpolated to the original 5 m grid size. In addition to comparing index distribution functions, a second objective was to evaluate differences in spatial patterns. Thus the values of TWI and its components as computed for the seven different DEMs were compared in three different ways: (1) distribution functions and their statistics; (2) cell by cell comparison of four DEMs with the same resolution but different information content; and (3) comparison of blocks of cells within different resolution DEMs with different information content. Like previous TWI studies, the computed specific upstream area decreased on average for higher resolution DEMs while computed slope values followed a narrower distribution. TWI variation between neighbouring cells in 50 × 50 m areas decreased largely with increasing grid size. A cell by cell comparison of the TWI values of the four 5 m DEMs with different information content showed a clear decrease in correlation with the TWI based on the original DEM with decreasing information content. The results showed considerable differences between topographic indices computed for DEMs of different grid resolution. Interpolating the DEMs to a higher resolution (i.e. a smaller grid size) provided more similar TWI distributions, but the pixel by pixel comparison showed that different information contents caused clearly different TWI maps. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Land component boundaries often coincide with transitions in environmental land properties such as soil, climate and biology. Image segmentation is an effective method for delineating terrain morphological units from digital elevation models (DEMs). This paper compares the land components derived from five DEMs. The second version of the 30-m advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global DEM (ASTER GDEM2), the 90-m shuttle radar topography mission DEM (SRTM DEM), two versions of the 5-m Stellenbosch University DEMs (SUDEM L1 and L2) and a 5-m DEM (GEOEYE DEM) derived from GeoEye stereo-images were considered. The SRTM DEM and the ASTER GDEM2 were upsampled to 5-m resolution for comparison purposes. Land components were delineated using the slope gradient and aspect derivatives of each DEM. The resulting land components were visually inspected and quantitatively analyzed using the slope gradient standard deviation (SGSD) measure and the mean slope gradient local variance (MSGLV) ratio. The results show that the GEOEYE DEM and SUDEM L2 yielded land components with relatively low SGSD values and that their boundaries often coincide with morphological discontinuities. The GEOEYE DEM produced land components with the highest MSGLV ratio, followed by SUDEM L2, ASTER GDEM2, SRTM DEM and SUDEM L1. Although the land components derived from SRTM DEM and SUDEM L1 were relatively homogeneous internally, their boundaries did not always trace morphological discontinuities. The ASTER GDEM2 failed to incorporate many of the morphological discontinuities in the study area. It is concluded that, although the SRTM DEM is more suitable than the ASTER GDEM2 for generating land components, higher-resolution DEMs such as the GEOEYE DEM and SUDEM L2 are required for delineating meaningful land components. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Topographical data sources and digital elevation model (DEM) interpolation and filtering methods are described in relation to the requirements of environmental models. Accurate representation of surface shape and drainage structure is a common requirement, and is facilitated by the development of locally-adaptive, process-based DEM interpolation techniques. The role of traditional contour data sources and remotely-sensed data sources is also examined. Methods for interpreting terrain include terrain parameters, as simplifications of key environmental processes, and a range of terrain features associated with secondary terrain structures. The issue of spatial scale is discussed in relation to the multi-scale requirements of environmental modelling and the identification of scaling properties of DEMs and associated terrain parameters. Multi-scale terrain feature analysis permits the incorporation of terrain structure into analyses of scale.},

It also discusses ways of producing models of the land-surface, from sampling procedures to digital elevation model (DEM) gridding techniques. An extensive comparison of the methods used to derive first and second order derivatives from DEMs have been presented. Mathematical models of the land surface have their uses, but it can be dangerous to regard them as being universally applicable, or even as capturing the essence of a real land surface. Understanding the concept of the land surface and its specific properties is a first step toward successful geomorphometric analysis. Ignoring aspects, such as the correct definition of a reference vertical datum, the density and distribution of the initial height observations, and the accuracy of measurement, can lead to serious artefacts and inaccuracies in the outputs of geomorphometric analysis.},

abstract = {We investigated two approaches for large-scale analysis and prediction of the spatial distribution of soil properties in an agricultural landscape in the Canadian prairies. The first approach was based on the implementation of nine types of digital terrain models (DTMs) and regression analysis of soil and topographic data. The second approach used a concept of accumulation, transit, and dissipation zones of the landsurface. Soil properties were soil moisture, residual phosphorus, solum thickness, depth to calcium carbonate, and organic carbon content. The dependence of soil properties on topography was supported by correlations for the upper soil layer. However, topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus decreased with depth. Also, correlation coefficients and regression equations describing topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus differed among seasons. This imposes limitations on regression-based predictions of the spatial distribution of soil properties. The prediction of soil property distribution with the concept of accumulation, transit and dissipation zones can be more successful and appropriate than the prediction based on linear regression. The variability in relationships between soil and topographic characteristics with depth may stem from spatial variability in the rate of decline of hydraulic conductivity with depth. Temporal variability in soil–topography relationships occurs because soil properties result from interactions of a variety of pedogenetic factors and processes marked by different temporal variability. In soil studies with digital terrain modelling, there is a need to take into account four types of variability in relations between soil and relief: regional, temporal, depth, and scale.},

abstract = {The central problem of a combined analysis of digital terrain models (DTMs) and other landscape data is determination of a DTM grid size (w) providing a correct study of relationships between topographic variables and landscape properties. Generally, an ‘adequate' w is determined by an expert estimate, and solutions are largely subjective. We developed an experimental statistical method to determine an adequate w for DTMs applied to landscape studies. The method includes the following steps: (a) derivation of a DTM set using a series ofwi, (b) performance of a correlation analysis of data on a landscape property and a topographic variable estimated with various wi , (c) plotting of correlation coe? cients obtained versus w, and (d) determination of smoothed plot portions indicating intervals of an adequate w.We applied the method developed to study the in? uence of topography on the spatial distribution of soil moisture (M) at a micro-scale. We investigated the dependence of M on gradient (G), horizontal (kh), vertical (kv), and mean (H) landsurface curvatures. For DTM derivation, we used 13 values of wi from 1 to 7m. An interval of adequate wi for M falls between 2.25 and 3.25m in the given terrain conditions. In absolute magnitudes, correlation coe? cients are largest within this interval; correlation coe? cients of M with G, kh, kv and H are {\~{O}} 0.28, {\~{O}} 0.52, {\~{O}} 0.50 and {\~{O}} 0.60, respectively, for w5 3m. The results obtained demonstrate that the method actu- ally works to identify an adequate w at a micro-scale. The method developed allows estimation of an adequate area of landform which ‘realise' a topographic control of landscape properties.},

The 16 main features of these data sets are reported from a geodetic point of view. Comparison at about 1 billion 17 locations identifies artefacts (e.g., residual cloud patterns and stripe effects) in ASTER. For DEM-9S, the 18 comparisons against the space-collected SRTM and ASTER models demonstrate that signal omission 19 (due to the {\~{}}270 m spacing) may cause errors of the order of 100-200 m in some rugged areas of 20 Australia. Based on a set of geodetic ground control points (GCPs) over Western Australia, the vertical 21 accuracy of DEM-9S is {\~{}}9 m, SRTM {\~{}}6 m and ASTER {\~{}}15 m. However, these values vary as a function 22 of the terrain type and shape. Thus, CGIAR-CSI SRTM ver4.1 may represent a viable alternative to 23 DEM-9S for some applications. While ASTER GDEM has an unprecedented horizontal resolution of 24 {\~{}}30m, systematic errors present in this research-grade version of the ASTER GDEM ver1 will impede its 25 immediate use for some applications},

abstract = {80{\%} of arable land in Africa has low soil fertility and suffers from physical soil problems. Additionally, significant amounts of nutrients are lost every year due to unsustainable soil management practices. This is partially the result of insufficient use of soil management knowledge. To help bridge the soil information gap in Africa, the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project was established in 2008. Over the period 2008-2014, the AfSIS project compiled two point data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database and the AfSIS Sentinel Site database. These data sets contain over 28 thousand sampling locations and represent the most comprehensive soil sample data sets of the African continent to date. Utilizing these point data sets in combination with a large number of covariates, we have generated a series of spatial predictions of soil properties relevant to the agricultural management-organic carbon, pH, sand, silt and clay fractions, bulk density, cation-exchange capacity, total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, Al content and exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg, Na). We specifically investigate differences between two predictive approaches: random forests and linear regression. Results of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the random forests algorithm consistently outperforms the linear regression algorithm, with average decreases of 15-75{\%} in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across soil properties and depths. Fitting and running random forests models takes an order of magnitude more time and the modelling success is sensitive to artifacts in the input data, but as long as quality-controlled point data are provided, an increase in soil mapping accuracy can be expected. Results also indicate that globally predicted soil classes (USDA Soil Taxonomy, especially Alfisols and Mollisols) help improve continental scale soil property mapping, and are among the most important predictors.

abstract = {In this paper we analyse the effects of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution on the results of a model that simulates spatially explicit relative shallow landslide hazard and soil redistribution patterns and quantities. We analyse distributions of slope, specific catchment area and relative hazard for shallow landsliding for four different DEM resolutions (grid sizes of 10, 25, 50 and 100 m) of a 12 km2 study area in northern New Zealand. The effect of DEM resolution is especially pronounced for the boundary conditions determining a valid hazard calculation. For coarse resolutions, the smoothing effect results in a larger area becoming classified as unconditionally stable or unstable. We apply simple empirical soil redistribution algorithms for scenarios in which all sites with a certain landslide hazard fail and generate debris flow. The lower initial number of failing cells but also the inclusion of slope (limit) in those algorithms becomes apparent with coarser resolutions. For finer resolutions, much larger amounts of soil redistribution are found, which is attributed to the more detailed landscape representation. Looking at spatial patterns of landslide erosion and sedimentation, the size of the area affected by these processes also increases with finer resolutions. In general, landslide erosion occupies larger parts of the area than deposition, although the total amounts of soil material eroded and deposited are the same. Analysis of feedback mechanisms between soil failures over time shows that finer resolutions show higher percentages of the area with an increased or decreased landslide hazard. When the extent of sites with lower and higher hazards are compared, finer grid sizes and higher landslide hazard threshold scenarios tend to increase the total extent of areas becoming more stable relative to the less stable ones. Extreme care should be taken when quantifying landslide basin sediment yield by applying simple soil redistribution formulas to DEMs with different resolutions. Rather, quantities should be interpreted as relative amounts. For studying shallow landsliding over a longer timeframe, the 'perfect' DEM resolution may not exist, because no resolution can possibly represent the dimensions of all different slope failures scattered in space and time. We assert that the choice of DEM resolution, possibly restricted by data availability in the first place, should always be adapted to the context of a particular type of analysis.

abstract = {Understanding the linkages between structure and processes in soil landscapes involves analyses across several spatial and temporal scales. The transfer of information between scales requires the (1) identification of respective scale levels and (2) procedures for regionalization. Here, we present a multiparameter delineation of landform units and their attribution with typical Reference Soil Groups (RSG) of a landscape of NE Germany which is representative of young moraine regions. Data sources are a digital elevation model (DEM, 5 m x 5 m), a reference data set from sections of an intensively augered landscape, and expert knowledge. A conceptual digital soil map was constructed in the scale 1: 5000 based on the Topographic Position Index (TPI). The methodology is applicable for multiscale analyses. Results are (1) the landform unit classified by digital terrain analysis of a DEM, (2) the attribution of RSG, and (3) the evaluation of the classification. Accuracy of the method was 57{\%} overall, with 70{\%} accuracy on typical erosional sites. The developed method allows identification of terrain-related soil pattern with high spatial resolution in glacial-drift areas. The high resolution of soil information can be used for delineation of management zones in precision farming, or as input for process studies and models requiring a translation of typological soil information into relevant soil properties (e. g., by pedotransfer functions).},

abstract = {A Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied to spectral as well as mono- and multi-seasonal textural features extracted from Landsat TM imagery to increase the accuracy of land cover classification over a complex Mediterranean landscape, with a large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Five different types of geostatistical textural measure for three different window sizes and three different lags were applied creating a total of 972 potential input variables. Madograms, rodograms and direct variograms for the univariate case and cross- and pseudo-cross variograms for the multivariate case, together with multi-seasonal spectral information, were used in a RF classifier to map the land cover types. The pseudo-cross and cross variograms were used specifically to incorporate important seasonal/temporal information. Incorporating multi-scale textural features into the RF models led to an increase in the overall index of 10.71{\%} and, for the most accurate classification, the increase was up to 30{\%} in some classes. The differences in the kappa coefficient for the textural classification models were evaluated statistically using a pairwise Z-test, revealing a significant increase in per-class classification accuracy compared to GLCM-based texture measures. The pseudo-cross variogram between the visible and near-infrared bands was the most important textural features for general classification, and the multi-seasonal pseudo-cross variogram had an outstanding importance for agricultural classes. Overall, the RF classifier applied to a reduced subset of input variables composed of the most informative textural features led to the highest accuracy. Highly reliable classification results were obtained when the 16 most important textural features calculated at single scales (window sizes) were selected and used in the classification. The proposed methodology significantly increased the classification accuracy achieved with a spectral maximum likelihood classifier (ML). The kappa values for the textural RF and ML classifications were equal to 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The spatial variability of remotely sensed image values provides important information about the arrangement of objects and their spatial relationships within the image. The characterisation of spatial variability in such images, for example, to measure of texture, is of great utility for the discrimination of land cover classes. To this end, the variogram, a function commonly applied in geostatistics, has been used widely to extract image texture for remotely sensed data classification. The aim of this study was to assess the increase in accuracy that can be achieved by incorporating univariate and multivariate textural measures of Landsat TM imagery in classification models applied to large heterogeneous landscapes. Such landscapes which difficult to classify due to the large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Madogram, rodogram and direct variogram for the univariate case, and cross- and pseudocross variograms for the multivariate one, together with multi-seasonal spectral information were used in a Random Forest classifier to map land cover types. The addition of spatial variability into multi-seasonal Random Forest models leads to an increase in the overall accuracy of 8{\%}, and to an increase in the Kappa index of 9{\%}, respectively. The increase in per categories Kappa for the textural Random Forest model reached 30{\%} for certain categories. This study demonstrates that the use of information on spatial variability produces a fundamental increase in per class classification accuracy of complex land-cover categories. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Invasive nonindigenous plants are threatening the biological integrity of North American rangelands, as well as the economies that are supported by those ecosystems. Spatial information is critical to fulfilling invasive plant management strategies. Traditional invasive plant mapping has utilized ground-based hand or GPS mapping. The shortfalls of ground-based methods include the limited spatial extent covered and the associated time and cost. Mapping vegetation with remote sensing covers large spatial areas and maps can be updated at an interval determined by management needs. The objective of the study was to map leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) using 128-band hyperspectral (5-m and 3-m resolution) imagery and assess the accuracy of the resulting maps. Beiman Cutler classifications (BCC) were used to classify the imagery using the randomForest package in the R statistical program. BCC builds multiple classification trees by repeatedly taking random subsets of the observational data and using random subsets of the spectral bands to determine each split in the classification trees. The resulting classification trees vote on the correct classification. Overall accuracy was 84{\%} for the spotted knapweed classification, with class accuracies ranging from 60{\%} to 93{\%}; overall accuracy was 86{\%} for the leafy spurge classification, with class accuracies ranging from 66{\%} to 93{\%}. Our results indicate that (1) BCC can achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over single classification trees with these data and (2) it might be unnecessary to have separate accuracy assessment data when using BCC, as the algorithm provides a reliable internal estimate of accuracy. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Image geometric accuracy and spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions are important aspects for se- lecting satellite imagery for agricultural and environmental monitoring. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the geometrical and resolution characteristics of RapidEye images (processing level: 3A). Three images were used in this study. These images were corrected for the atmospheric effects and stored in 16-bit radiometric resolution, where the surface refl ectance was determined and rescaled from 0 to 10,000. Eight points extracted from the orthophoto mosaic were used to evaluate the geometric characteristics of the orthorectifi ed images. Ten points extracted from these ortho- photo mosaics were used to register the images using fi rst-degree equations, in order to obtain homologous samples of pixels. Four pixels from Eucalyptus plantation, cultivated pasture, bare soil and water from a sand extraction pit and a river mouth were used to characterize spectrally the surface refl ectance derived from the RapidEye images. Results showed that average positional errors were 3.66 m and 10.07 m respectively for E and N coordinates, compliant with Cartographic Accuracy Standards (PEC) of class A at the scale of 1:20,000. Surface refl ectance of the selected targets were consistent with the typical refl ectance curves available in the literature. It is concluded that the RapidEye images are suitable for monitoring agricultural areas, pastures, forested areas and for environmental monitoring in general. The 12-bit quantization is interesting for these applications as it can represent a large variety of radiances coming from the surface.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed images are affected by the atmosphere, thus influencing the extraction of surface information from the images. Atmospheric correction by means of radiative transfer models is a way of eliminating or minimizing this problem. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the atmospheric correction of an image of theALOS/AVNIR-2 sensor using the6S (Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) model. The sensor filter function and the calibration coefficientswere implemented in the 6S model. Then an AVNIR-2 image was corrected for atmospheric effects. Samples were collected in the non-corrected and corrected images to evaluate the atmospheric correction by comparing the surface bidirectional reflectance (corrected) with bidirectional reflectance at satellite level (non-corrected). The results show that surfacebidirectional reflectance valuescorrectedby the modelare similar to thespectral signaturesof each target,while the bidirectionalreflectance values from uncorrectedimage were not similar to expected target spectral response. It is concluded that the atmospheric correction of AVNIR-2 enabled the calculation of surface bidirectional reflectance. This correction is necessary especially when the images will be used to estimate surface parameters through target spectral characteristics.The adapted 6S model is suitablefor the atmospheric correction of ALOS/AVNR-2 images},

abstract = {A new method for a composite evaluation of atmospheric resistance, surface resistance, and evapotranspiration rate (??E) is applied to Landsat-5 TM. The method uses three equations to solve for three variables: the atmospheric resistance between the surface and the air (rae); the surface resistance (rs); and the vapour pressure at the surface (es). The novelty of this approach is the estimation of es, which is assessed using the decoupling coefficient (??) by Jarvis and McNaughton [Adv. Ecol. Res. 15 (1986) 1]. The input parameters are: surface temperature (Ts), net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), air temperature (Ta), and air humidity (ea). A time series (100 days) of field data collected for a wheat crop is used to illustrate the method, which is validated using latent heat fluxes recorded by the eddy covariance technique. The control of ras on ??E is expressed through the Surface Control Coefficient (SCC = 1 - ??), which is compared to soil moisture data. The application of the technique in a remote sensing monitoring context is demonstrated for a Danish agricultural landscape containing crops at different stages of development. For the satellite-based estimation of ??E and SCC, the variables Ts, Rn, and G are calculated on the basis of Landsat-5 TM, which leaves solar irradiance (for computing Rn), Ta, and ea as the only field data required. The method is directly applicable without any calibration when the soil surface is moist or when the vegetation cover is dense. Only for a dry bare soil surface, where the effective source area of water vapour is below the surface, is the modification of a surface humidity parameter (hs,max) required. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Landslide inventory mapping is an indispensable prerequisite for reliable hazard and risk analysis, and with the increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery the creation and updating of such inventories on regular bases and directly after major events is becoming possible. The diversity of landslide processes and spectral similarities of affected areas with other landscape elements pose major challenges for automated image processing, and time-consuming manual image interpretation and field surveys are still the most commonly applied mapping techniques. Taking advantage of recent advances in object-oriented image analysis (OOA) and machine learning algorithms, a supervised workflow is proposed in this study to reduce manual labor and objectify the choice of significant object features and classification thresholds. A sequence of image segmentation, feature selection, object classification and error balancing was developed and tested on a variety of sample datasets (Quickbird, IKONOS, Geoeye-1, aerial photographs) of four sites in the northern hemisphere recently affected by landslides (Haiti, Italy, China, France). Besides object metrics, such as band ratios and slope, newly introduced topographically-guided texture measures were found to enhance significantly the classification, and also feature selection revealed positive influence on the overall performance. With an iterative procedure to examine the class-imbalance within the training sample it was furthermore possible to compensate spurious effects of class-imbalance and class-overlap on the balance of the error rates. Employing approximately 20{\%} of the data for training, the proposed workflow resulted in accuracies between 73{\%} and 87{\%} for the affected areas, and approximately balanced commission and omission errors. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration, and a better understanding of the spatial patterns of SOC is essential for soil resource management. In this study, we used boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) models to map the distribution of topsoil organic carbon content at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in China. A set of 105 soil samples and 12 environmental variables (including topography, climate and vegetation) were analyzed. The performance of the models was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Maps of the mean values and standard deviations of SOC were generated to illustrate model variability and uncertainty. The results indicate that the BRT and RF models exhibited very similar performance and yielded similar predicted distributions of SOC. The two models explained approximately 70{\%} of the total SOC variability. The BRT and RF models robustly predicted the SOC at low observed SOC values, whereas they underestimated high observed SOC values. This underestimation may have been caused by biased distributions of soil samples in the SOC space. Vegetation-related variables were assigned the highest importance in both models, followed by climate and topography. Both models produced spatial distribution maps of SOC that were closely related to vegetation cover. The SOC content predicted by the BRT model was clearly higher than that of the RF model in areas with greater vegetation cover because the contributions of vegetation-related variables in the two models (65{\%} and 43{\%}, respectively) differed significantly. The predicted SOC content increased from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the study area, average values produced by the BRT and RF models were 27.3 g kg-1 and 26.6 g kg-1, respectively. We conclude that the BRT and RF methods should be calibrated and compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC spatial distribution in similar regions. In addition, vegetation variables, including those obtained from remote sensing imagery, should be taken as the main environmental indicators and explicitly included when generating SOC maps in Alpine environments.},

Random Forest is an ensemble of unpruned classification or regression trees created by using bootstrap samples of the training data and random feature selection in tree induction. Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging) the predictions of the ensemble. We built predictive models for six cheminformatics data sets. Our analysis demonstrates that Random Forest is a powerful tool capable of delivering performance that is among the most accurate methods to date. We also present three additional features of Random Forest: built-in performance assessment, a measure of relative importance of descriptors, and a measure of compound similarity that is weighted by the relative importance of descriptors. It is the combination of relatively high prediction accuracy and its collection of desired features that makes Random Forest uniquely suited for modeling in cheminformatics.},

abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of ecosystem health, with a great potential to affect climate change. This study aimed to develop, evaluate, and compare the performance of support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF) models in predicting and mapping SOC stocks in the Eastern Mau Forest Reserve, Kenya. Auxiliary data, including soil sampling, climatic, topographic, and remotely-sensed data were used for model calibration. The calibrated models were applied to create prediction maps of SOC stocks that were validated using independent testing data. The results showed that the models overestimated SOC stocks. Random forest model with a mean error (ME) of -6.5 Mg C ha-1 had the highest tendency for overestimation, while SVR model with an ME of -4.4 Mg C ha-1 had the lowest tendency. Support vector regression model also had the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (14.9 Mg C ha-1 and 0.6, respectively); hence, it was the best method to predict SOC stocks. Artificial neural network predictions followed closely with RMSE, ME, and R2 values of 15.5, -4.7, and 0.6, respectively. The three prediction maps broadly depicted similar spatial patterns of SOC stocks, with an increasing gradient of SOC stocks from east to west. The highest stocks were on the forest-dominated western and north-western parts, while the lowest stocks were on the cropland-dominated eastern part. The most important variable for explaining the observed spatial patterns of SOC stocks was total nitrogen concentration. Based on the close performance of SVR and ANN models, we proposed that both models should be calibrated, and then the best result applied for spatial prediction of target soil properties in other contexts.},

abstract = {An important issue in ecohydrological research is distribution modelling, aiming at the prediction of species or vegetation type occurrence on the basis of empirical relations with hydrological or hydrogeochemical habitat conditions. In this study, two statistical techniques are evaluated: (i) the widely used multiple logistic regression technique in the generalized linear modelling framework, and (ii) a recently developed machine learning technique called 'random forests'. The latter is an ensemble learning technique that generates many classification trees and aggregates the individual results. The two different techniques are used to develop distribution models to predict the vegetation type occurrence of 11 groundwater-dependent vegetation types in Belgian lowland valley ecosystems based on spatially distributed measurements of environmental conditions. The spatially distributed data set under investigation consists of 1705 grid cells covering an area of 47.32 ha. After model construction and calibration, both models are applied to independent test data sets using two-fold cross-validation and resulting probabilities of occurrence are used to predict vegetation type distributions within the study area. Predicted vegetation types are compared with observations, and the McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model at the 0.001 significance level. Comparison of the modelling results for each individual vegetation type separately by means of the F-measure, which combines precision and recall, also reveals better predictions by the random forest model. Inspection of the probabilities of occurrence of the different vegetation types for each grid cell demonstrates that correct predictions in central areas of homogeneous vegetation sites are based on high probabilities, whereas the confidence decreases towards the margins of these areas. Threshold-independent evaluation of the model accuracy by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirms good performances of both models, but with higher values for the random forest model. Therefore, the incorporation of the random forest technique in distribution models has the ability to lead to better model performances. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that Visible Near InfraRed (Vis-NIR) hyperspectral imagery is a cost-efficient way to map soil properties at fine resolutions ({\~{}}. 5. m) over large areas. However, such mapping is only feasible for the soil surface because the effective penetration depths of optical sensors do not exceed several millimeters. This study aims to determine how Vis-NIR hyperspectral imagery can serve to map the subsurface properties at four depth intervals (15-30. cm, 30-60. cm, 60-100. cm and 30-100. cm) when used with legacy soil profiles and images of parameters derived from digital elevation model (DEM). Two types of surface-subsurface functions, namely linear models and random forests, that estimate subsurface property values from surface values and landscape covariates were first calibrated over the set of legacy measured profiles. These functions were then applied to map the soil properties using the hyperspectral-derived digital surface soil property maps and the images of landscape covariates as input. Error propagation was addressed using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the mapping uncertainties.The study was conducted in a pedologically contrasted 300km2-cultivated area located in the Cap Bon region (Northern Tunisia) and tested on three soil surface properties (clay and sand contents and cation exchange capacity). The main results were as follows: i) fairly satisfactory (cross-validation R2 between 0.55 and 0.81) surface-subsurface functions were obtained for predicting the soil properties at 15-30cm and 30-60cm, whereas predictions at 60-100cm were less accurate (R2 between 0.38 and 0.43); ii) linear models outperformed random-forest models in developing surface-subsurface functions; iii) due to the error propagations, the final predicted maps of the subsurface soil properties captured from 1/3 to 2/3 of the total variance with a significantly decreasing performance with depth; and iv) these maps brought significant improvements over the existing soil maps of the region and showed soil patterns that largely agreed with the local pedological knowledge. This paper demonstrates the added value of combining modern remote sensing techniques with old legacy soil databases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Statistical models were adapted to predict the spatial distribution of soil texture from terrain parameters. For this purpose, 56 soil profiles were analysed horizon-wise by pipette and laser method. Results by pipette compared to laser method showed the expected shift to higher silt and lower clay contents. Linear regression equations were adapted. The performance of regression tree (RT) and Random Forest (RF) models was compared by hundredfold model runs on random Jackknife partitions. Digital soil maps of sand, silt and clay percentage mean and standard deviation indicate model variability and prediction uncertainty. RF models performed better than RT models. All terrain factors considered in the analysis influenced soil texture of the surface horizon, but altitude a.s.l. was assigned the highest variable importance during model construction. Shallow subsurface flow is considered responsible for increasing sand/clay ratios with increasing altitude, on steep slopes and with overland flow distance to the channel network by removing clay particles downslope. Deeper soil layers are not influenced by this process and therefore, did not show the same texture properties. However, the influence of parent material and landslides on the spatial distribution of soil texture cannot be neglected. Model performance, most probably, could be improved by a bigger dataset. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fire occurrence, which results from the presence of an ignition source and the conditions for a fire to spread, is an essential component of fire risk assessment. In this paper, we present and compare the results of the application of two different methods to identify the main structural factors that explain the likelihood of fire occurrence at European scale.Data on the number of fires for the countries of the European Mediterranean region during the main fire season (June-September) were obtained from the European Fire Database of the European Forest Fire Information System. Fire density (number of fires/km 2) was estimated based on interpolation techniques and was used as the dependent variable in the model. As predictors, different physical, socio-economic and demographic variables were selected based on their potential influence in fire occurrence and on their availability at the European level. Two different methods were applied for the analysis: traditional Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest, the latter being a non-parametric alternative based on an ensemble of classification and regression trees. The predictive ability of the two models, the variables selected by each method and their level of importance were compared and the potential implications to forest management and fire prevention were discussed.The Random Forest model showed a higher predictive ability than Multiple Linear Regression. Furthermore, the analysis of the residuals also indicated a better performance of the Random Forest model, showing that this method has potentiality to be applied in the assessment of fire-related phenomena at a broad scale. Some of the variables selected are common to both models; precipitation and soil moisture seem to influence fire occurrence to a large extent. Unemployment rate, livestock density and density of local roads were also found significant by both methods. Maps of the likelihood of fire occurrence were obtained from each method at 10. km resolution, based on the selected variables. Both models show that the spatial distribution of fire occurrence likelihood is highly variable in this region: highest fire likelihood is prevalent in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula and southern Italy, whereas it is low in northern France, northeast Italy and north of Greece. In the most fire-prone areas, preventive measures could be implemented, associated to the factors identified by both models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning.In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92{\%} overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20{\%}, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Detailed knowledge on the spatial distribution of soils is crucial for environmental monitoring, management, and modeling. However soil maps with a finite number of discrete soil map units are often the only available information about soils. Depending on the map scale or the detailing of the map legend this information could be too imprecise. We present a method for the spatial disaggregation of map units, namely the refinement of complex soil map units in which two or more soil types are aggregated. Our aim is to draw new boundaries inside the map polygons to represent a single soil type and no longer a mixture of several soil types. The basic idea for our method is the functional relationship between soil types and topographic position as formulated in the concept of the catena. We use a comprehensive soil profile database and topographic attributes derived from a 10. m digital elevation model as input data for the classification of soil types with random forest models. We grouped all complex map units which have the same combination of soil types. Each group of map units is modeled separately. For prediction of the soil types we stratified the soil map into these groups and apply a specific random forest model only to the associated map units. In order to get reliable results we define a threshold for the predicted probabilities at 0.7 to assign a specific soil type. In areas where the probability is below 0.7 for every possible soil type we assign a new class "indifferent" because the model only makes unspecific classification there. Our results show a significant spatial refinement of the original soil polygons. Validation of our predictions was estimated on 1812 independent soil profiles which were collected subsequent to prediction in the field. Field validation gave an overall accuracy of 70{\%}. Map units, in which shallow soils were grouped together with deep soils could be separated best. Also histosols could be predicted successful. Highest error rate were found in map units, in which Gleysoils were grouped together with deep soils or Anthrosols. To check for validity of our results we open the black box random forest model by calculating the variable importance for each predictor variable and plotting response surfaces.

abstract = {The saturation problem associated with the use of NDVI for biomass estimation in high canopy density vegetation is a well known phenomenon. Recent field spectroscopy experiments have shown that narrow band vegetation indices computed from the red edge and the NIR shoulder can improve the estimation of biomass in such situations. However, the wide scale unavailability of high spectral resolution satellite sensors with red edge bands has not seen the up-scaling of these techniques to spaceborne remote sensing of high density biomass. This paper explored the possibility of estimate biomass in a densely vegetated wetland area using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from WorldView-2 imagery, which contains a red edge band centred at 725 nm. NDVI was calculated from all possible two band combinations of WorldView-2. Subsequently, we utilized the random forest regression algorithm as variable selection and a regression method for predicting wetland biomass. The performance of random forest regression in predicting biomass was then compared against the widely used stepwise multiple linear regression. Predicting biomass on an independent test data set using the random forest algorithm and 3 NDVIs computed from the red edge and NIR bands yielded a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.441 kg/m2 (12.9{\%} of observed mean biomass) as compared to the stepwise multiple linear regression that produced an RMSEP of 0.5465 kg/m2 (15.9{\%} of observed mean biomass). The results demonstrate the utility of WorldView-2 imagery and random forest regression in estimating and ultimately mapping vegetation biomass at high density-a previously challenging task with broad band satellite sensors. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = { Statistical classification of byperspectral data is challenging because the inputs are high in dimension and represent multiple classes that are sometimes quite mixed, while the amount and quality of ground truth in the form of labeled data is typically limited. The resulting classifiers are often unstable and have poor generalization. This work investigates two approaches based on the concept of random forests of classifiers implemented within a binary hierarchical multiclassifier system, with the goal of achieving improved generalization of the classifier in analysis of hyperspectral data, particularly when the quantity of training data is limited. A new classifier is proposed that incorporates bagging of training samples and adaptive random subspace feature selection within a binary hierarchical classifier (BHC), such that the number of features that is selected at each node of the tree is dependent on the quantity of associated training data. Results are compared to a random forest implementation based on the framework of classification and regression trees. For both methods, classification results obtained from experiments on data acquired by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer instrument over the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and by Hyperion on the NASA Earth Observing 1 satellite over the Okavango Delta of Botswana are superior to those from the original best basis BHC algorithm and a random subspace extension of the BHC.},

abstract = {Spatial estimates of tropical soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and stocks are crucial to understanding the role of tropical SOC in the global carbon cycle. They also allow for spatial variation of SOC in environmental process models. SOC is spatially highly variable. In traditional approaches, SOC concentrations and stocks have been derived from estimates for single or very few profiles and spatially linked to existing units of soil or vegetation maps. However, many existing soil profile data are incomplete and untested as to whether they are representative or unbiased. Also single means for soil or vegetation map units cannot characterize SOC spatial variability within these units. We here use the digital soil mapping approach to predict the spatial distribution of SOC. This relies on a soil inference model based on spatially referenced environmental layers of topographic attributes, soil units, parent material, and forest history. We sampled soils at 165 sites, stratified according to topography and lithology, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, at depths of 0-10??cm, 10-20??cm, 20-30??cm, and 30-50??cm, and analyzed them for SOC by dry combustion. We applied Random Forest (RF) analysis as a modeling tool to the SOC data for each depth interval in order to compare vertical and lateral distribution patterns. RF has several advantages compared to other modeling approaches, for instance, the fact that it is neither sensitive to overfitting nor to noise features. The RF-based digital SOC mapping approach provided SOC estimates of high spatial resolution and estimates of error and predictor importance. The environmental variables that explained most of the variation in the topsoil (0-10??cm) were topographic attributes. In the subsoil (10-50??cm), SOC distribution was best explained by soil texture classes as derived from soil mapping units. The estimates for SOC stocks in the upper 30??cm ranged between 38 and 116??Mg ha- 1, with lowest stocks on midslope and highest on toeslope positions. This digital soil mapping approach can be applied to similar landscapes to refine the spatial resolution of SOC estimates. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in soil fertility and C cycle. Detailed information about the spatial distribution of SOM is vital to effective management of soil fertility and better understanding of the process of C cycle. To date, however, few studies have been carried out to digitally map the spatial variation of SOM for rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation at the regional scale in Hainan Island, China. In this study, a hybrid approach, random forest plus residuals kriging (RFRK), was proposed to predict and map the spatial pattern of SOM for the rubber plantation. A total of 2511 topsoil (0-20cm) samples were extracted from a soil fertility survey data set of the Danzhou County. These soil samples were randomly divided into calibration dataset (1757 soil samples) and validation dataset (754 soil samples). In this study, stepwise linear regression (SLR), random forest (RF), and random forest plus residuals kriging (RFRK) were used to predict and map the spatial distribution of SOM for the rubber plantation, while generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) and classification and regression tree (CART) were employed to uncover relationships between SOM and environmental variables and further to identify the main factors influencing SOM variation. The RFRK model was developed to predict spatial variability of SOM on the basis of terrain attributes, geological units, climate factors, and vegetation index. Performance of RFRK was compared with SLR. Mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were selected as comparison criteria. Results showed that RFRK performed much better than SLR in predicting and mapping the spatial distribution of SOM for the rubber plantation. The RFRK model had much lower prediction errors (ME, MAE, and RMSE) and higher R2 than SLR. Values of ME, MAE, RMSE, and R2 were 0.26g/kg, 1.35g/kg, 2.19g/kg, and 0.86 for RFRK model, and were 0.65g/kg, 2.99g/kg, 4.37g/kg, and 0.43 for SLR equation, respectively. Moreover, RFRK model yielded a more realistic spatial distribution of SOM than SLR equation. The good performance of RFRK model could be ascribed to its capabilities of dealing with non-linear and hierarchical relationships between SOM and environmental variables and of accounting for unexplained information in the random forest (RF) model residuals. These results suggested that RFRK was a promising approach in predicting spatial distribution of SOM for rubber plantation at regional scale. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are fundamental in assessing soil variability and are regularly used in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as a scale benchmark for all the other environmental covariates. They are conventionally used at their original grid resolution with a conventional 3??3 window size for the computation of the derived terrain attributes. The choice of scale frames the analysis and shapes the end result suggesting that better attention and quantitative knowledge of scale may improve predictive performance. Previous studies have shown the influence of pixel size but have not investigated in detail the interacting effect between window and pixel sizes. The aim of this study was to examine the scale dependency of soil classification performance at the landscape scale using two machine-learning techniques commonly applied in DSM: artificial neural networks and random forest. These were applied in three different areas in terms of their geomorphology and soil type located in Ireland. A series of DEMs representing different scales were created from the original 20m DEM by smoothing and re-sampling it with different window and pixel sizes for a total of 143 combinations: the original, 10 smoothed but not re-sampled, 12 re-sampled and not smoothed, and 120 smoothed and re-sampled. These were used to generate 11 terrain parameters from which 4 points per km2 were randomly extracted and used to predict soil classes. The overall prediction accuracy in the three study areas varied between 35{\%} and 60{\%}. Pixel size was found significant in all areas, the interaction between window and pixel sizes significant in morphologically rough areas and window size was significant only in flat homogeneous areas at coarser resolutions (above 140m in this study). In general, predictive performance was best at very fine and very coarse scales in morphologically varied areas, coarse scales in flat homogenous areas and relatively scale invariant in mixed areas. We conclude by examining whether this empirical approach is appropriate to compare scale combinations to obtain a better prediction accuracy of DSM techniques. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The history of digital soil mapping and modeling (DSMM) is marked by adoption of new mapping tools and techniques, data management systems, innovative delivery of soil data, and methods to analyze, integrate, and visualize soil and environmental datasets. DSMM studies are diverse with specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local, national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soil-centered, but consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two high-impact international soil science journals - Geoderma and Soil Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space. The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v) distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix) quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method. Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be operationalized in soil mapping/modeling programs, research gaps, and future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties, quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be ideally in balance. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These methods have been proven to improve classification accuracy considerably. The most widely used ensemble methods are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known ensemble methods on multisource remote sensing and geographic data. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Microarray studies yield data sets consisting of a large number of candidate predictors (genes) on a small number of observations (samples). When interest lies in predicting phenotypic class using gene expression data, often the goals are both to produce an accurate classifier and to uncover the predictive structure of the problem. Most machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, are useful for classification. However, these methods provide no insight regarding the covariates that best contribute to the predictive structure. Other methods, such as linear discriminant analysis, require the predictor space be substantially reduced prior to deriving the classifier. A recently developed method, random forests (RF), does not require reduction of the predictor space prior to classification. Additionally, RF yield variable importance measures for each candidate predictor. This study examined the effectiveness of RF variable importance measures in identifying the true predictor among a large number of candidate predictors. An extensive simulation study was conducted using 20 levels of correlation among the predictor variables and 7 levels of association between the true predictor and the dichotomous response. We conclude that the RF methodology is attractive for use in classification problems when the goals of the study are to produce an accurate classifier and to provide insight regarding the discriminative ability of individual predictor variables. Such goals are common among microarray studies, and therefore application of the RF methodology for the purpose of obtaining variable importance measures is demonstrated on a microarray data set. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present a new digital terrain analysis framework for digital soil mapping, referred to as contextual elevation mapping (ConMap). In contrast to common regression approaches based on features from digital terrain analysis, ConMap is not based on standard terrain attributes, but on elevation differences from the centre pixel to each pixel in circular neighbourhoods only. These differences are used as features in random forest regressions. We applied and validated the framework by predicting topsoil silt content in a loess region of 1150 km2 in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse, Germany. Three hundred and forty-two samples and a 20-m resolution digital elevation model were used for this illustration and validation. We compared ConMap with standard and multi-scale terrain analysis approaches as well as with ordinary kriging interpolations. Cross-validation root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 16.1 when the standard digital terrain analysis was used to 11.2 when ConMap was used. This corresponds to an increase in variance explained (R2) from 15 to 61{\%}. Even though ordinary kriging out-performed standard terrain analysis as well, the variance explained was 6{\%} smaller compared with that using ConMap. The results show that the geomorphic settings in the study area must have induced the spatial trend, which can be accounted for by ConMap over different scales. We conclude that ConMap shows great potential for digital soil mapping studies.},

abstract = {The increasing demand of visiting natural areas, and the fact that these areas sometimes coincide with fragile ecosystems cause negative impacts on the environment. In recent years, visitation pressure has been increasing for all natural areas because of the popularization of ecotourism. Therefore, increasingly, it is necessary to find ways to cope with the impacts from visitation without necessarily reducing or curtailing its use. Hence, evaluation and monitoring of public use impacts are considered key tools for managing visitation. Given the above, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of public use on a trail of the Itatiaia National park, the Brejos trail, which has seen intensified use in recent years, and to provide data that can support management proposals. As a method of evaluating the conditions of the trail and its attractions, we used VIM (Visitor Impact Management). This includes the selection of impact-Ievel indicators and verifiers, the evaluation of appropriateness of selected variables, the collection of data throughout the area, the comparison of data obtained in standard or ideal situations, and the proposal of management measures. The results show that the trail is still relatively well preserved, with various drainage points made by the community that uses it, and a pronounced degree of erosion which has apparently stabilized, a few bifurcations along a total stretch of 3.5 km, and low impact on wildlife and vegetation surrounding the trail.},

abstract = {The Bocaina Plateau, which is situated on the eastern flank of the continental rift of southeastern Brazil, is the highest part of the Serra do Mar. Topographic relief in this area is suggested to be closely related to its complex tectono-magmatic evolution since the breakup of Western Gondwana and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Apatite fission track ages and track length distributions from 27 basement outcrops were determined to assess these hypotheses and reconstruct the denudation history of the Bocaina Plateau. The ages range between 303 ?? 32 and 46 ?? 5. Ma, and are significantly younger than the stratigraphic ages. Mean track lengths vary from 13.44 ?? 1.51 to 11.1 ?? 1.48 ??m, with standard deviations between 1.16 and 1.83 ??m. Contrasting ages within a single plateau and similar ages at different altitudes indicate a complex regional tectonothermal evolution. The thermal histories inferred from these data imply three periods of accelerated cooling related to the Early Cretaceous continental breakup, Early Cretaceous alkaline magmatism, and the Paleogene evolution of the continental rift of southeastern Brazil. The oldest fission track ages ({\textgreater} 200. Ma) were obtained in the Serra do Mar region, suggesting that these areas were a long-lived source of sediments for the Paran??, Bauru, and Santos basins. ?? 2010 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {(Myrceugenia (Myrtaceae) occurring in Itatiaia National Park, Rio de Janeiro) A morphological and taxonomic analysis of the species of Myrceugenia O. Berg (Myrtaceae) in Itatiaia National Park, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was carried out. In addition to determining the species present in the Park, the usefulness of vegetative and floral characters as diagnostic tools was evaluated. The study includes descriptions, an identification key, observations made in the field and from herbarium collections. Eight taxa were identified: Myrceugenia alpigena (DC.) Landrum var. alpigena; M. bracteosa (DC.) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel; M. campestris (DC.) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel; M. cucullata D. Legrand; M. glaucescens var. latior Burret (Landrum); M. miersiana (Gardner) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel, M. ovata var. regnelliana (O. Berg) Landrum and M. seriatoramosa (Kiaersk.) D. Legrand {\&} Kausel. Diagnostic characters found useful were the shapes of the inflorescence, the flower bud, the prophyll and the calyx-lobes, as well as the presence or absence of an intramarginal vein. Vegetative characters alone are not diagnostic to distinguish the species of Myrceugenia in the Park. Two new occurrences for the state of Rio de Janeiro were registered: M. campestris and M. cucullata.},

Com o objetivo de investigar o comportamento das vari{\'{a}}veis comunit{\'{a}}rias da flora arb{\'{o}}rea em condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es diferentes de altitude e alagamento, determinou-se a composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o flor{\'{i}}stica, estrutura e similaridade entre tr{\^{e}}s fragmentos de floresta (aluvial, montana e nebular) e a suas rela{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es flor{\'{i}}sticas com estudos da regi{\~{a}}o. Foram amostrados 2.572 indiv{\'{i}}duos, identificados em 194 esp{\'{e}}cies, distribu{\'{i}}das em 59 fam{\'{i}}lias e 118 g{\^{e}}neros. As fam{\'{i}}lias com maior riqueza foram Myrtaceae (30 esp{\'{e}}cies), Lauraceae (20), Melastomataceae (17) e Fabaceae (13). Os tr{\^{e}}s tipos de vegeta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o estudados, associados a diferentes condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es ambientais, diferem entre si em sua composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e estrutura. A floresta aluvial revelou-se com reduzida diversidade, baixa estatura e alta domin{\^{a}}ncia ecol{\'{o}}gica. A floresta nebular destacou-se por apresentar elementos t{\'{i}}picos de altitude em detrimento de esp{\'{e}}cies freq{\"{u}}entes na regi{\~{a}}o abaixo da escarpa da serra, onde a diversidade foi maior. A flora arb{\'{o}}rea da Serra Negra, formada pelo conjunto das {\'{a}}reas estudadas, apresenta um conjunto consider{\'{a}}vel de elementos com distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o caracter{\'{i}}stica de ambientes montanhosos do Sudeste do Brasil. Serra Negra is a region surrounded by some stretches of mountain, covered by Atlantic Forests and cloud scrubs, located in the southern part of Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais, in Serra da Mantiqueira, between the rises of the massif of Itatiaia (RJ, SP e MG) and the Serra do Ibitipoca (MG). The aim of this study was to determine the composition, structure and floristic similarity of arboreal flora among three forest types of Atlantic Forest (Alluvial, Montane and Cloud Forest) and also the similarity with other studies. A total of 2,572 individuals was sampled, from 194 species, 59 families and 118 genera. The highest number of species was recorded in the families Myrtaceae (30 morphospecies), Lauraceae (20), Melastomataceae (17) and Fabaceae (13). The three vegetation types associated with different environmental conditions differ in their composition and structure. The alluvial proved with low diversity and stature and high ecological dominance. The cloud forest stood out for its typical elements of altitude over other common species in the area below the range, where diversity was higher. The tree flora of Sierra Negra presents various indicator species to characteristic distribution of highlands of southeastern Brazil.},

abstract = {The Serra do Mar rift system is the most significant Cenozoic tectonic feature of the onshore continental area of southeastern Brazil. This system exhibits a two-fold tectonic evolution, marked by a distensive synsedimentary stage in Paleocene-Oligocene times and a strike-slip stage of post-Oligocene age. Recent investigations and re-examination of previously described outcrops in the Resende and Taubat?? Basins, depressions of the rift system, have revealed late Pleistocene sedimentary deposits also affected by strike-slip faulting of the second tectonic stage or even of a third one. In the Taubat?? Basin, some colluvium and stone-lines are faulted, with development of positive and negative flower structures. On the other hand, positive flower structures of the Resende Transpressional Zone have tilted alluvial terraces of the Para??ba do Sul valley. Both situatins are related to major E-W transcurrence. No absolute age dates are available for Taubat?? and Resende deposits. However, comparisons with the adjacent Para??ba do Sul River stratigraphy suggest that colluvium and stone-lines, as well as alluvial terraces, are of late Pleistocene age or younger. Fault plane solutions of two swarms of reservoir-induced events, close to the area concerned, had strike-slip and overthrust focal mechanisms related to an average E-W compressive regional stress direction. The similarity of the stress fields is thus strongly indicative of a neotectonic E-W compressive event that appears to have been active, at least as residual tectonism, up to the present day. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Four tree species were harvested periodically over a 13-year period from plantations in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica: Cedrela odorata, Cordia alliodora, Hyeronima alchorneoides, and Euterpe oleracea. The soil was a well-drained, volcanic alluvium, and high fertility coupled with 4 m of annual rainfall and high temperatures led to rapid growth rates; at age 13 many individual were {\textgreater} 30 cm dbh and {\textgreater} 30 m tall. Harvested trees were dissected into their component parts: leaves, rachises (for Cedrela and Euterpe), branches, boles, and coarse roots (i.e., {\textgreater} 0.5 cm diameter). Roots of small trees were excavated in their entirety; those of large trees were harvested from a cylinder 1.0 m in diameter, immediately beneath the trunk. Large numbers of trees were sampled: 258-379 per species. Size classes sampled ranged from seedlings too small to have a dbh to trees of similar to 30 cm dbh. Two separate allometric equations (one for trees having only a basal diameter and another for trees having a dbh), with diameter squared times height as the metrics, were developed for each component of each species. Based on breaks in linear trends of In-In plots and deviations of predicted from actual values, we developed separate allometric equations, by component, for trees of different sizes. The resulting 40 equations (with one exception, involving very small trees) fit the data well and enable the user to predict biomass, by component, for each of the four species. A single (non-allometric) linear equation, combining all plant parts of all three dicot species, also fit the data well, but it would not provide either the detail or the accuracy provided by the species-specific, plant-part-specific equations. Large sample sizes, a 13-year run of data collection, and the economic and ecological importance of the species studied make this data set uniquely useful for biomass estimations and for understanding the inherent heterogeneity of tree structure in dynamic tropical environments.

abstract = {Five rainforest areas situated inthe ItatiaiaMountainRange,states ofMinas GeraisandRio de Janeiro,SEBrazil, were surveyed in order to produce a checklist of tree species of the regional forests. This checklist resulted from floristic surveys carried out in the five forest fragments, and phytosociological surveys in three of them. An additional checklist produced for a forest area situatedon the Itatiaia southern slopes, state of Rio de Janeiro, was extracted fromthe literature to help assessing the variations in floristic composition. The tree flora sampled in the five studied areas was composed of 450 species, 191 genera and 69 families, many of which are known as characteristic ofmontane forests (situated above 1,000m of altitude). The tree flora of the Itatiaia Range forests may be considered as one of the richest in species among areas of montane rain forest in SE Brazil. A cluster analysis identified patterns of floristic similarityamongthe six forest areasof the ItatiaiaRangewhichwere related to the occurrence of periodic floods in an area of alluvial rain forest, to differences in slope aspect (oceanic or continental) among the five areas of montane rain forest, and to the early sucessional stage of one of these. The highest similarity was obtained between the areas of mature montane rain forest of the continental slope, in Aiuruoca and Bocaina de Minas, although the geographical distance between them was much greater than the distances between the latter and the areas of alluvial forest and early sucessional forest.},

En Venezuela, la materia de geopedolog{\'{i}}a era el componente esencial de un taller organizado per{\'{i}}odicamente para entrenar el personal del Ministerio de Obras P{\'{u}}blicas (MOP) y, posteriormente, del Ministerio del Ambiente y Recursos Naturales Renovables (MARNR) encargados de realizar los levantamientos de suelos. La materia de geopedolog{\'{i}}a se dict{\'{o}} tambi{\'{e}}n como parte de un curso de postgrado sobre Ecolog{\'{i}}a de Paisajes organizado en repetidas veces por la Facultad de Ciencias de la Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV). En Colombia, talleres similares se han realizado en varias oportunidades en el marco de un convenio de cooperaci{\'{o}}n entre el ITC y el Instituto Geogr{\'{a}}fico Agust{\'{i}}n Codazzi (IGAC). En el ITC, la materia de geopedolog{\'{i}}a, bajo la denominacion de Physiography and Soils, se dict{\'{o}} como parte de un curso de postgrado anual sobre levantamiento de suelos en el per{\'{i}}odo de 1986-2004. Despu{\'{e}}s de un largo per{\'{i}}odo de recesi{\'{o}}n y casi olvido, el tema del suelo como recurso de usos m{\'{u}}ltiples, base de soporte a diversas formas de vida, y prestador de servicios ambientales, ha vuelto, aunque t{\'{i}}midamente, a figurar en las agendas pol{\'{i}}ticas nacionales e internacionales.

abstract = {The Arrozal Granite, situated in the southwestern region of the State of Rio de Janeiro, has a granitic to granodioritic composition. It contains a strong mylonitic foliation along its border, passing gradually to a well-developed magmatic foliation towards its center. Structural analysis indicates that the Arrozal Granite was emplaced along the Al{\'{e}}m-Para{\'{i}}ba Shear Zone in a dextral transpressive tectonic regime. A regional shift of the trend along this shear zone from NE-SW to E-W, observed in the area, is interpreted to be casually related to the creation of space for the emplacement of the granite. Our data indicate that releasing bends may have played an important role for space generation during the emplacement of the Arrozal Granite and other plutons.},

abstract = {This paper presents the impact of ecotourism1 on livelihood and natural resource management in the periphery of Amboseli Biosphere Reserve in Kenya. Ecotourism initiatives that have been introduced by Porini Ecotourism, a private investor, are benefiting Eselenkei Group Ranch in terms of income, improved infrastructure, employment opportunities and exposure. Over US{\$}5000 is received annually as land rent, gate fee and bed charges. Twenty-six Maasai men are employed for the upkeep of project facilities. The community's capacity to facilitate resource-related conflicts has improved following support from development institutions. An expanding livelihood base is reducing local vulnerability to disaster and people–wildlife conflicts. The numbers of resident wildlife species in the conservation area have increased due to regeneration of woody species and reduced frequency of livestock. Despite the achievements, ecotourism is threatened by cultivation. The latter is jeopardizing conservation efforts, as the area frequented by wildlife is being lost and people–wildlife conflicts intensified. Another dilemma is that the Eselenkei community is not effectively participating in ecotourism a situation that is associated with inadequate management and negotiation skills in the group ranch committee. The latter requires leadership and microenterprise management skills if earnings from ecotourism are to be effectively invested in alternative sources of livelihood, to reduce current and potential conflicts. There is also need to build the community's capacity for the promotion of activities that compliment ecotourism. Frequent breakdown of community boreholes lead to dependence on the conservation area for water during prolonged drought, intensifying conflicts between livestock and wildlife},

abstract = {The development of conservation ideal and the rise of tourist modalities such as ecotourism and geotourism increased the interest of urban populations for natural areas. This increase visitation in areas of environmental preservation is positive with respect to the disclosure of biotic and abiotic heritage. However, access to this type of attraction is mostly done through trails, and the increasing use of them can act as vectors for the spread of many environmental disturbances, such as exposure, compaction and soil erosion. To understand these processes of degradation of trails was used as the study area of the Carteiro trail, located at Serra S{\~{a}}o Jos{\'{e}} Environmental Protection Area, in the Tiradentes county, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The analysis is based on the use of the method of Cross Sectional Area (CSA), and estimation of soil compaction in the bed and on the edges of the trail. Were separated several checkpoints along the trail, where the methodology proposed was applied. These sections were analyzed, yielding values of soil loss in square centimeters and compaction rates in megapascals},

abstract = {This study applied a newmethod for detailed surveys of short-termdynamics in the surface of recreational trails. Themain objectives of this studywere: (1) to analyze the spatial aspect of surface changes inmicroscale; (2) to quantify precisely the short-term rate of soil loss and deposition. Measurements were taken in 12 test fields, located in two protected natural areas in the south of Poland: the Gorce National Park and Poprad Landscape Park. The measuring places were located on trails characterized by different slopes, types of vegetation, and types of use. Each of the test fields was established by four special marks, firmly dug into the ground. The use of precise elevation data provided by the electronic total station and digital elevation models (DEMs) of differ- ence allowed us to assess the sediment budget of the surface changes. The proposed method allowed for obtaining information not only for profile lines but also for specified areas. In such a way, the spatial and temporal dynamics of geomorphologic processes influencing the trail tread could be studied. During a two-year period (2008–2010), soil loss dominated within 10 test fields, while a predominance of deposition was recorded for the remaining two. The average net volumetric change of the trail surface varied from−0.035 m3 m−2 per year to+0.005 m3 m−2 per year. The short-term dynam- ics was high and several test fields had a positive balance (predominance of deposition) in one period and negative balance (predominance of soil loss) in the next period. Local geomorphic conditions, morphology of the trail tread and soil properties seemed to be the most important factors contributing to the relief trans- formation. No connection was demonstrated between the amount of use (i.e. number of visitors) or type of use and the amount of soil loss or deposition. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {Protected natural areas are often subjected to severe human impacts including recreational-related impacts. Walking, hiking, horse riding, bicycling and backpacking are the most popular outdoor recre- ational activities in many protected areas. Trampling of vegetation and soil erosion are two main indi- cators of trail impact. Understanding and modelling factors related to trail and forest road degradation are crucial to park managers, who are responsible for the preservation of natural conditions and the maintenance of recreational opportunities. It is usually impossible to make direct measurements of all the factors that determine the trail impact. Hence, the use of GIS modelling to assess environmental sensitivity is encouraged. In this study, two variables have been used (1 e vulnerability of plant communities to trampling; 2 e vulnerability of soil to erosion processes) to assess the spatial distribution of areas with diversified degrees of environmental sensitivity to trail impact. These variables can be relatively easily collected and spatially modelled using GIS. The model presented in the study is simple and can be easily calculated with limited data. Although 50{\%} of the area of the Gorce National Park has potentially medium or low environmental sensitivity to trail impact, over 36{\%} of its recreational trails and forest roads are constructed in sensitive areas. These roads are highly susceptible to gully erosion. One result of the model used in this study is the qualitative assessment of environmental sensitivity. Although it does not provide quantitative results (e.g. a maximum allowed number of tourists per day), it allows to study the spatial distribution of environmental vulnerability and to compare selected areas. For example, results provided by the proposed methodology can be used to determine which areas are resilient and therefore are predisposed to recreational use, and which are vulnerable and should be protected from severe human impact. ?},

abstract = {One of the most important tasks for managers of many natural protected areas is achieving a balance between conservation of nature and recreational opportunity. This paper presents a framework based on geographic information system (GIS) and regression tree analysis of optimized recreational trail location for flexible, user-defined input parameters. The method utilizes: (1) the GIS to create a database con- taining field data and existing GIS/cartographic materials; (2) regression tree analysis to establish the relationships between indicators of degradation and environmental and use-related factors for existing trails, as well as to predict trail degradation for potential new trials; (3) least-cost path algorithm within a GIS framework to optimize trail route. The frameworkwas applied to the Gorce National Park in the south of Poland. A large sample ({\textgreater}4500) of the field collected data about degradation of the existing trail networkwas linked with data about soil, geology, geomorphology and relief, and with information about the type and amount of recreational use. Based on the existing relationship, predicted trail degradation was calculated and routes for two ex- amples of trails (hiking and motorized) were designated. The proposed methodology is objective and quantitative, and can also include knowledge of local stakeholders. The framework has the potential to design new trails (or to re-route old ones), characterized by the best possible solution for recreational and conservation functions to coexist, by routing visitors through trails with the lowest possible impact.},

abstract = {Landscape heterogeneity analysis is fundamental in ecotourism planning since it estimates an optimal relationship between conservation and tourist alternatives. The landscape methodology approach enables to describe not only the scenic beauty, but also the degrees of stability in ecological systems. Landscape research for ecotourism integrates the different natural components (relief, climatic conditions, soil, vegetation cover etc.) and evaluates their interrelationships with the characteristics of the tourist destination. The geomorphology is often regarded as one of the most important factors controlling the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape in areas with high topographic variation. In this case, landform parameters indicate temperature and moisture distribution, exposure towards wind, vegetation, habitats etc. The study area is the Serra dos {\'{O}}rg{\~{a}}os National Park, one of Brazil's most visited national parks, with a vast number of options for ecotourism visitors, such as ecological diversity, historical significance and recreational opportunities. The present paper aims to define the landscape units of Serra dos {\'{O}}rg{\~{a}}os National Park from the remote sensing and terrain attributes. Moreover the paper analyzes the distribution of tourist attraction in relation to the landscape units. Thus, the analysis procedure considers the types of landscapes, spatial structures and limitations. The methodology can be divided in the following stages: (a) digital processing of the terrain attributes images from digital elevation model; (b) remote sensing image interpretation, and (c) delimitation and analysis of the ecotourism attraction. The data integration enabled to identify units in two different hierarchical scale levels. In the geosystem scale, seven classes had been identified presenting different dynamics and environmental vulnerabilities. The method of landscape analysis for ecotourism provided a holistic perspective as well as recreational potential evaluation},

abstract = {abstract Recreational uses of unsurfaced trails inevitably result in their degradation, with the type and extent of resource impact influenced by factors such as soil texture, topography, climate, trail design and main- tenance, and type and amount of use. Of particular concern, the loss of soil through erosion is generally considered a significant and irreversible form of trail impact. This research investigated the influence of several use-related, environmental, and managerial factors on soil loss on recreational trails and roads at Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area, a unit of the U.S. National Park Service. Regression modeling revealed that trail position, trail slope alignment angle, grade, water drainage, and type of use are significant determinants of soil loss. The introduction of individual and groups of variables into a series of regression models provides improved understanding and insights regarding the relative influence of these variables, informing the selection of more effective trail management actions. Study results suggest that trail erosion can be minimized by avoiding ‘‘fall-line'' alignments, steep grades, and valley-bottom alignments near streams, installing and maintaining adequate densities of tread drainage features, applying gravel to harden treads, and reducing horse and all-terrain vehicle use or restricting them to more resistant routes. This research also sought to develop a more efficient Variable Cross-Sectional Area method for assessing soil loss on trails. This method permitted incorporation of CSA measures in a representative sampling scheme applied to a large (24{\%}) sample of the park's 526 km trail system. The variety of soil loss measures derived from the Variable CSA method, including extrapolated trail-wide soil loss estimates, permit an objective quantification of soil erosion on recreational trails and roads. Such data support relational analyses to increase understanding of trail degradation, and long-term monitoring of the natural and recreational integrity of the trail system infrastructure},

The trail is the most investigated used for the practice of ecotourism and recreational activities. We used a cone penetrometer with ring dynamometer for determining rates of soil compaction between 0 and 15 cm deep, at points equally spaced at 200 m along the trail known as the Farofa Trail. The results indicate a significant difference in rates penetrometer in and out of the trail bed investigated. These indexes suggest that the Farofa Trail as well as other trails nearby, have the necessary conditions for the establishment of various impacts related to compaction of the soil surface. The type and intensity of use of each user group of trails, associated with features of soil and vegetation, physiographic and other characters, are determining factors in the rates of compaction of the trail and are investigated in the research process.},

This study aims to evaluate the effect of the movement of people in some soil physical properties of the State Park trails Cerrado (PR) to guide future actions in planning the use and occupation of the area that contribute to the preservation of the ecosystem. To evaluate the physical soil were collected at random points, 5 soil samples off track (FTr) and track (Tr) with preserved structure in the depth of 0-20 cm. With these samples, we determined the bulk density, total porosity, macro and micro, organic matter and aggregate stability. The trails of the state park Cerrado (PR) receiving more than 50 visitors over the month, showed no degradation as the organic matter content and soil aggregation in relation to the area of native soil.},

A calculation technique of the Cross Sectional Area was used to analyze the impact of erosion on the trail bed, whose results showed progressive deepening of the bed, resulting in intensified and concentrated erosion, increasing even more the problems encountered in the trail, and also found that in some places there was an accumulation of sediment, and both the loss and the accumulation of sediments has a direct relationship with the slope and the type of local soil. Also was performed the use of photographic records to conduct a comparative analysis between two times when the trail had evidence of erosive processes and it was possible to register a drastic change occurred on site.},

This study combined ecological measures of off-trail resource impacts with social science techniques to understand visitor judgments of ecological impacts and visitors' degree of expo- sure to impacts. Specifically, this paper reports on a novel integration of techniques thatwas tested in the Bear Lake Road Corridor of Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA in which resource change, as a result of visitor use off designated trails and sites, was assessed and combined with social science and visitor use data. Visual survey techniques were used to understand visitor judgments of ecologically important resource impacts and GPS-tracking of visitor use and behavior allowed for the determination of the degree of visitor's exposure to impaired resources. Results suggest that resource impacts are prevalent and intense throughout the area, but tended to be spatially limited in proximity to attraction sites. Visitors are interacting with resource conditions reported to be unacceptable for significant portions of their hikes. Overall, the work represents an advancement of predictive capabilities when managing park and protected area resources.},

abstract = {This paper presents the conditioned Latin hypercube as a sampling strategy of an area with prior information represented as exhaustive ancillary data. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a stratified random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. For conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) the problem is: given N sites with ancillary variables (X), select x a sub-sample of size n(n ??? N) in order that x forms a Latin hypercube, or the multivariate distribution of X is maximally stratified. This paper presents the cLHS method with a search algorithm based on heuristic rules combined with an annealing schedule. The method is illustrated with a simple 3-D example and an application in digital soil mapping of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, and equal spatial strata. The results show that the cLHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Prediction of soil attributes (properties and classes) in digital soil mapping (DSM) is based on the correlation between primary soil attributes and secondary environmental attributes. These secondary attributes can be obtained relatively cheaply over large areas. In the presence of these environmental covariates, a strategic sampling design needs to ensure the coverage of the full range of environmental variables. This could enhance the full representation of the expected soil properties or soil classes. This chapter presents the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) as a sampling strategy on existing data layers. LHS is a stratified-random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. This method is illustrated with examples from DSM of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, equal spatial strata and principal component (PC). Results showed that the LHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.},

abstract = {The conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) method is a popular sampling allocation method within the digital soil mapping community, and allows soil practitioners to make use of existing information to produce an optimized sampling stratification. However, it often produces sam- pling schemes that are scattered around the landscape, resulting in plans that are costly to implement. This paper proposes to enhance the cLHS method by incorporating operational constraints into it, so that the output can be implemented in a cost-effective fashion. The cost of reaching each point in the landscape from the road network has been assessed using terrain and landcover attributes. This cost layer has then been used in the optimisation process of the cLHS algorithm to penalise the points that are difficult or impossible to reach in the field, and guide the sampling process towards schemes that are easier to imple- ment operationaly. Results are illustrated using a real example in New Zealand.},

@article{Clifford2014,
abstract = {We review and give a practical example of Latin hypercube sampling in soil science using an approach we call flexible Latin hypercube sampling. Recent studies of soil properties in large and remote regions have highlighted problems with the conventional Latin hypercube sampling approach. It is often impractical to travel far from tracks and roads to collect samples, and survey planning should recognise this fact. Another problem is how to handle target sites that, for whatever reason, are impractical to sample - should one just move on to the next target or choose something in the locality that is accessible? Working within a Latin hypercube that spans the covariate space, selecting an alternative site is hard to do optimally. We propose flexible Latin hypercube sampling as a means of avoiding these problems. Flexible Latin hypercube sampling involves simulated annealing for optimally selecting accessible sites from a region. The sampling protocol also produces an ordered list of alternative sites close to the primary target site, should the primary target site prove inaccessible. We highlight the use of this design through a broad-scale sampling exercise in the Burdekin catchment of north Queensland, Australia. We highlight the robustness of our design through a simulation study where up to 50{\%} of target sites may be inaccessible. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {The accuracy of digital elevation models (DEM) and DEM-derived products depends on several factors, including the horizontal resolution and vertical precision at which the elevation data are represented, and the source of the elevation data. This accuracy becomes increasingly important as we extend the use of DEM data for spatial prediction of soil attributes. Our objective was to compare terrain attributes and quantitative soil-landscape models derived from grid-based DEM represented at different horizontal resolutions (10 and 30 m), represented at different vertical precisions (0.1 and 1 m), and acquired from different sources. Decreasing the horizontal resolution of the field survey DEM produced lower slope gradients on steeper slopes, steeper slope gradients on flatter slopes, narrower ranges in curvatures, larger specific catchment areas in upper landscape positions, and lower specific catchment areas values in lower landscape positions. Overall, certain landscape features were less discernible on the 30-m DEM than on the 10-m DEM. Decreased vertical precision produced a large proportion of points with zero slope gradient and zero slope curvature, and a large number of steeply sloping and more highly curved areas. Differences among DEM from different sources were more significant, with less accurate representation of depressions and drainage pathways with the USGS DEM as compared to the field survey DEM. Empirical models developed from different DEM included similar predictive terrain attributes, and were equally successful in predicting A-horizon depth (AHD) in the validation data set. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {This study aimed to present the methodological approach of the agroecological zoning of Mato Grosso do Sul State. The approach incorporated quantitative and qualitative assessment, with geotechnologies (satellite image–landsat 5, global positioning system, geographic information system, digital mapping, software of digital image processing) adoption to perform an integrated analysis of environmental data. Primary soils information associated with terrain attributes and climate characteristics were used with geotechnologies to evaluation of the natural erosion potential, natural fertility, internal drainage and moisture soil retention capacity of soil. The land use, and land cover and the environmental laws were observed. The integrated analysis of these data allowed environmental stratification in different agroecological zones. These zones are defined to agricultural use; pastures; conservation of natural resources or ecological restoration. In Bandeirantes case study, the agroecological zones recommended for agriculture sum 1,150 km2. The evaluation for conservation of natural resources and ecological results in 310 km2, and for the areas recommended for pastures sum 1,650 km2 or 53{\%} of Bandeirantes municipality. This study allows conclude that the integrated analysis of environmental data with application of geotechnologies can subsidize a quantitative and qualitative assessment, stratifying the lands in different agroecological zones, each one with recommendations for sustainable use, and contributing as a powerful tool for spatial planning.},

In this study, three different levels of pasture degradation have been identified (moderate, strong and very strong) and an image composition of 3 bands was tested (covering the visible and the near infra-red) with 15 m of spatial resolution. The neural networks simulator used was the “Neural Java Network Simulator”, with a feed forward model and the learning algorithm of back propagation. The obtained results show that the classification using neural networks, while presenting a slightly superior result, had a statistically similar performance compared to the maximum likelihood, getting a Kappa index of 0.80, against 0.79, respectively. In relation to individual performances, the class that presented the greatest error of classification was pasture in the level of very strong degradation, while the largest accuracy in the classification was obtained for coffee, for both classifiers, with 100 and 96{\%} (respectively, Maxver and neural networks).},

abstract = {This chapter introduces the land-surface concept from both the geodetic and statistical perspectives, and reviews ways to represent it. It also discusses ways of producing models of the land-surface, from sampling procedures to digital elevation model (DEM) gridding techniques. An extensive comparison of the methods used to derive first and second order derivatives from DEMs have been presented. Mathematical models of the land surface have their uses, but it can be dangerous to regard them as being universally applicable, or even as capturing the essence of a real land surface. Understanding the concept of the land surface and its specific properties is a first step toward successful geomorphometric analysis. Ignoring aspects, such as the correct definition of a reference vertical datum, the density and distribution of the initial height observations, and the accuracy of measurement, can lead to serious artefacts and inaccuracies in the outputs of geomorphometric analysis.},

location to be used in the prediction of soil properties as soil
organic carbon seems to be an important tool to decrease costs and
subjectivity of sampling schemes. The main objective of this work
was to test this method in a no sampled area, aiming to evaluate
its efficiency in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) procedures. The results
show that this method was able to significantly increase the reliability
in the spatial distribution of the sampled points in Parque Estadual
da Mata Seca (PEMS). The study area is located in the North of Minas
Gerais State, Brazil, in Tropical Dry Forest (TDF) ecosystems mainly.
In this study, the cLHS algorithm developed by Minasny {\&} McBratney
(2006) was used, in addition to some ancillary data as Land Use/Land
Cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order
to select 60 soil sampling location to the study of soil organic
carbon and others soil properties. The cLHS will be further analyzed
in its performance to select representative points to be sampled
and how this method could be helpful for DSM.},

ArcView environment, several sets of multiple logistic regressions
were defined using statistical software Minitab, establishing relationship
between explanatory terrain variables and soil types, using either
the original legend or a simplified legend, and using or not stratification
of the study area by drainage classes. Terrain parameters, such as
elevation, distance to stream, flow accumulation, and topographic
wetness index, were the variables that best explained soil distribution.
Stratification by drainage classes did not have significant effect.
Simplification of the original legend increased the accuracy of the
method on predicting soil distribution.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate three different environmental fragility models within the Brazilian rainforest region and to use the results to develop environmental zone classes. Two rural river basins located in Ibiuna, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, were studied. Input variables, including slope class, relief dissection rate, soil class, lithology, land cover, and climate data, were used to compute environmental fragility classes using three standard models. The model outputs were evaluated on their ability to accurately predict the most sensitive and least sensitive areas. The best models for each region were used to derive environmental zoning maps, including restoration priorities, best regions for agriculture, and areas with high needs for soil management. These maps will help support land use strategies for environmental restoration. This study provides insight into territorial ordering and management of environmental services with a regional perspective. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in model-based optimization of sampling designs for mapping. This paper is an update of the overview of sampling designs for mapping presented by de Gruijter et al. (2006). For model-based estimation of values at unobserved points (mapping), probability sampling is not required, which opens up the possibility of optimized non-probability sampling. Non-probability sampling designs for mapping are regular grid sampling, spatial coverage sampling, k-means sampling, conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, response surface sampling, Kennard-Stone sampling and model-based sampling. In model-based sampling a preliminary model of the spatial variation of the soil variable of interest is used for optimizing the sample size and or the spatial coordinates of the sampling locations. Kriging requires knowledge of the variogram. Sampling designs for variogram estimation are nested sampling, independent random sampling of pairs of points, and model-based designs in which either the uncertainty about the variogram parameters, or the uncertainty about the kriging variance is minimized. Various minimization criteria have been proposed for designing a single sample that is suitable both for estimating the variogram and for mapping. For map validation, additional probability sampling is recommended, so that unbiased estimates of map quality indices and their standard errors can be obtained. For all sampling designs, R scripts are available in the supplement. Further research is recommended on sampling designs for mapping with machine learning techniques, designs that are robust against deviations of modeling assumptions, designs tailored at mapping multiple soil variables of interest and soil classes or fuzzy memberships, and probability sampling designs that are efficient both for design-based estimation of populations means and for model-based mapping.},

abstract = {The increase in digital soil mapping around the world means that appropriate
and efficient sampling strategies are needed for validation. Data
used for calibrating a digital soil mapping model typically are non-random
samples. In such a case we recommend collection of additional independent
data and validation of the soil map by a design-based sampling strategy
involving probability sampling and design-based estimation of quality
measures. An important advantage over validation by data-splitting
or cross-validation is that model-free estimates of the quality measures
and their standard errors can be obtained, and thus no assumptions
on the spatial auto-correlation of prediction errors need to be made.
The quality of quantitative soil maps can be quantified by the spatial
cumulative distribution function (SCDF) of the prediction errors,
whereas for categorical soil maps the overall purity and the map
unit purities (user's accuracies) and soil class representation (producer's
accuracies) are suitable quality measures. The suitability of five
basic types of random sampling design for soil map validation was
evaluated: simple, stratified simple, systematic, cluster and two-stage
random sampling. Stratified simple random sampling is generally a
good choice: it is simple to implement, estimation of the quality
measures and their precision is straightforward, it gives relatively
precise estimates, and no assumptions are needed in quantifying the
standard error of the estimated quality measures. Validation by probability
sampling is illustrated with two case studies. A categorical soil
map on point support depicting soil classes in the province of Drenthe
of the Netherlands (268 000 ha) was validated by stratified simple
random sampling. Sub-areas with different expected purities were
used as strata. The estimated overall purity was 58{\%} with a standard
error of 4{\%}. This was 9{\%} smaller than the theoretical purity computed
with the model. Map unit purities and class representations were
estimated by the ratio estimator. A quantitative soil map, depicting
the average soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of pixels in an area
of 81 600 ha in Senegal, was validated by random transect sampling.
SOC predictions were seriously biased, and the random error was considerable.
Both case studies underpin the importance of independent validation
of soil maps by probability sampling, to avoid unfounded trust in
visually attractive maps produced by advanced pedometric techniques.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has been increasingly used to provide quick and accurate spatial information to support decision-makers in agricultural and environmental planning programs. In this study, we used a DSM approach to map soils in western Haiti and compare the performance of the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) with Random Forest (RF) to classify the soils. The study area of 4,300 km2 is mostly composed of diverse limestone rocks, alluvial deposits, and, to a lesser extent, basalt. A soil survey was conducted whereby soils were described and classified at 258 sites. Soil samples were collected and subjected to physical and chemical analyses. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was used to select the most important covariates from auxiliary data, such as climate, lithology, and morphometric properties to describe the soil-landscape relationship. Mapping performance was assessed by the Kappa index and overall accuracy derived from a confusion matrix generated using a 5-fold cross validation process. In addition, an external mapping validation was carried out using an independent soil dataset. Accordingly, the soil dataset was split into 80{\%} and 20{\%} for training and validation of the models, respectively. No significant statistical difference (Z = 0.56{\textless} |1.96|) was found between maps generated with both classifiers (Kappa index 0.45 for MLR and 0.42 for RF). Based on the Kappa values, the classification performance can be characterized as moderate for both algorithms. Surprisingly, the RF classifier outperformed MLR in the validation process (Kappa values of 0.55 and 0.33, respectively). These results suggest a higher generalization ability of RF. However, no significant statistical difference (Z = 1.83{\textless} |1.96|) was observed. The soil map derived from RF indicated the occurrence of Leptosols (48.5{\%}), Gleysols (19.6{\%}), Chernozems (8{\%}), and Fluvisols (6.6{\%}) in most of the study area. The DSM approaches proved suitable for mapping soils in western Haiti and could be used in other parts of the country, thereby closing information gaps with regard to Haitian soils.},

abstract = {Effective soil management requires knowledge of the spatial patterns
of soil variation within the landscape to enable wise land use decisions.
This is typically obtained through time-consuming and costly surveys.
The aim of this study was to develop a cost-efficient methodology
for digital soil mapping in poorly-accessible areas. The methodology
uses a spatial model calibrated on the basis of limited soil sampling
and explanatory covariables related to soil-forming factors, developed
from readily available secondary information from accessible areas.
The model is subsequently applied in the poorly-accessible areas.
This can only be done if the environmental conditions in the poorly-accessible
areas are also found in the accessible areas in which the model is
developed. This study illustrates the methodology in an exercise
to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in the Limpopo
National Park, Mozambique. Readily-available secondary data was used
as explanatory variables representing the soil-forming factors. Conditions
in the accessible and poorly-accessible areas corresponded sufficiently
to allow the extrapolation of the spatial model into the latter.
The spatial variation of SOC in the accessible area was mostly described
by the sampling cluster (71.5{\%}) and the landscape unit (46.3{\%}). Therefore
ordinary (punctual) kriging (OK) and kriging with external drift
(KED) based on the landscape unit were used to predict SOC. A linear
regression (LM) model using only landscape stratification was used
as control. All models were independently validated with test sets
collected in both accessible and poorly-accessible areas. In the
former the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.42–0.50{\%}
SOC. The ratio between the RMSEP in the poorly-accessible and accessible
areas was 0.67–0.72, showing that the methodology can be applied
to predict SOC in poorly-accessible areas as successful as in accessible
areas. The methodology is thus recommended for areas with similar
access problems, especially for baseline studies and for sample design
in two-stage surveys.},

In two watersheds in northwestern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 1:50,000 scale conventional soils maps were used as reference maps. From the ASTER - GDEM Global Digital Elevation Model and the hydrographic network, maps of predictive variables were generated: elevation, slope, curvature, flow length, flow accumulation, topographic wetness index, and Euclidian distance of the streams. We used random sampling, and tested sampling densities that ranged from 0.1 to 4 points per hectare. Models were trained using Weka software, generating predictive models using different sizes of the final node to obtain decision trees of different sizes. The results indicate that when the size of the decision tree was not controlled, an increase in sampling density resulted in greater overall accuracy in accordance with the basic reference maps and an increase in the number of predicted soil mapping units. When the size of decision trees was controlled, an increase in sampling density did not affect the overall accuracy and had a very slight influence on the number of predicted mapping units.},

abstract = {In balanced sampling a linear relation between the soil property of interest and one or more covariates with known means is exploited in selecting the sampling locations. Recent developments make this sampling design attractive for statistical soil surveys. This paper introduces balanced sampling and demonstrates its potential utility and versatility. Latin hypercube sampling appears to be a special case of balanced sampling. When implemented as a balanced sampling design, the inclusion probabilities of the population units are known. Population parameters can then be estimated by design-based, model-assisted or model-based inference. In a simulation study balanced (b) random sampling, balanced coverage (bc) random sampling, and latin hypercube (lh) random sampling were compared in terms of the sampling distributions of number of unsampled marginal strata (U) measuring coverage of feature space, Mean Squared Shortest Distance (MSSD) measuring spatial coverage, and error in the estimated mean e. In designs b and bc four covariates were used as balancing variables. In bc the four covariates and the spatial coordinates were used as spreading variables. With lh the total sample size was random, but the size fluctuations were acceptable. Design lh clearly scored best with regard to U, but had by far the largest variance of e. Based on U and MSSD design bc outperformed design b, which can be explained by the use of spreading variables in bc. The variance of e for these designs was about 0.8 times the variance for simple random sampling. Using the ratio estimator for lh this variance ratio was about 1.8, showing the poor estimation performance of lh.},

abstract = {The main aim of spatial sampling is to collect samples in 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional space. It is typically used to estimate the total or mean for a parameter in an area, to optimize parameter estimations for unsampled locations, or to predict the location of a movable object. Some objectives are for populations, representing the "here and now", whereas other objectives concern superpopulations that generate the populations. Data to be collected are usually spatially autocorrelated and heterogeneous, whereas sampling is usually not repeatable. In various senses it is distinct from the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data from a population in conventional sampling. The uncertainty for spatial sample estimation propagates along a chain from spatial variation in the stochastic field to sample distribution and statistical tools used to obtain an estimate. This uncertainty is measured using either a design-based or modelbased method. Both methods can be used in population and superpopulation studies. An unbiased estimate with the lowest variance is thus a common goal in spatial sampling and inference. Reaching this objective can be addressed by sample allocation in an area to obtain a restricted objective function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We studied experimentally the consistency and generality of such rankings. Results of the studies indicate that there is no evidence supporting the belief in generality of such rankings. A high variance of variable importance evaluations was observed in the case of small number of trees and small data sets. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatial prediction of soil organic matter is a global challenge and of particular importance for regions with intensive land use and where availability of soil data is limited. This study evaluated a Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approach to model the spatial distribution of stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), total carbon (Ctot), total nitrogen (Ntot) and total sulphur (Stot) for a data-sparse, semi-arid catchment in Inner Mongolia, Northern China. Random Forest (RF) was used as a new modeling tool for soil properties and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) as an additional method for the analysis of variable importance. At 120 locations soil profiles to 1 m depth were analyzed for soil texture, SOC, Ctot, Ntot, Stot, bulk density (BD) and pH. On the basis of a digital elevation model, the catchment was divided into pixels of 90 m × 90 m and for each cell, predictor variables were determined: land use unit, Reference Soil Group (RSG), geological unit and 12 topography-related variables. Prediction maps showed that the highest amounts of SOC, Ctot, Ntot and Stot stocks are stored under marshland, steppes and mountain meadows. River-like structures of very high elemental stocks in valleys within the steppes are partly responsible for the high amounts of SOC for grasslands (81–84{\%} of total catchment stocks). Analysis of variable importance showed that land use, RSG and geology are the most important variables influencing SOC storage. Prediction accuracy of the RF modeling and the generated maps was acceptable and explained variances of 42 to 62{\%} and 66 to 75{\%}, respectively. A decline of up to 70{\%} in elemental stocks was calculated after conversion of steppe to arable land confirming the risk of rapid soil degradation if steppes are cultivated. Thus their suitability for agricultural use is limited.},

abstract = {Digital soil mapping involves the use of auxiliary data to assist in the mapping of soil classes. In this research, we investigate the predictive power of 6 data mining classifiers, namely Logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), random forest (RF), and decision tree model (DTM) to create a DSM across an area covering of 3000. ha in Kurdistan Province, north-west Iran. In this area, using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 217 soil profiles were selected, sampled, analysed and allocated to taxonomic classes according to Soil Taxonomy up to family level. To test the user accuracy (UA) we established a calibration and validation set (70:30{\%}). Of the 5 soil family classes we map, the highest overall accuracy (0.71) and kappa index (0.69) are achieved using the DTA and ANN method. More specifically, the UA of prediction was up to 18.33{\%} better in comparison to LR. Moreover, our results showed that no improvement was obtained in prediction accuracy of DTA algorithm with minimizing taxonomic distance compared to minimizing misclassification error (0.71). Overall, our results suggest that the developed methodology could be used to predict soil classes in the other regions of Iran.},
